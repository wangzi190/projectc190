Hi, my name's Hui (Chinese: 慧; pronounced "hway") and I'm an artist and computer science student. I also like <a href="/other-assets/Mathematician's Lament.pdf" target="_blank" class="clickable">math</a>, reading, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language" target="_blank" class="clickable">low-level programming</a>, computer history, mahjong, and far too many other things.

At the time of writing this, I am somewhat involved in security research while also juggling full-time school, life, and messing around on my computer when I feel like it, this site being a product of the latter.

What does “Project C190” mean?
<br><br>
At age 9, I started messing around on kids' programming website Scratch, publishing my work under the username C<span style="color:black;background:black;">_____</span>190. Before I knew it, I went from making Warrior Cats RPGs in blocks to dabbling in stuff like assembly language, and now I'm studying computer science in university. This website is named "Project C190" as a tribute to how my time on Scratch has shaped my interests. Also, fun fact, some of the graphics are drawn in Scratch with a mouse just as I would have done as a kid.
