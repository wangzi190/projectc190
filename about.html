Project C190 was a machine learning device able to process and analyze visual inputs. It was initialized in an experiment to determine whether machines could be "creative," via measurement by a "machine creativity index" developed by researchers at Ornis Technology. In the experiment, it demonstrated a miraculous ability not only to digitally reconstruct visual stimuli, but also to create its own interpretations of them. But for unknown reasons, the experiment was terminated in February 2005, when Project C190 also mysteriously disappeared. Few records on the device were recovered.
