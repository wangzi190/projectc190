A collection of excerpts that resonate(d) with me on a visceral level. I'm not really one to bare my soul to the entire Internet (or I don't know, maybe I have but just don't view it like that) so I suppose these authors can speak for me in a way.

"I always wanted you to admire my fasting," said the hunger artist.
<br>"But we do admire it," said the supervisor obligingly.
<br>"But you shouldn't admire it," said the hunger artist.
<br>"Well then, we don't admire it," said the supervisor, "but why shouldn't we admire it?"
<br>"Because I had to fast. I can't do anything else," said the hunger artist.
<br>"Just look at you," said the supervisor, "why can't you do anything else?"
<br>"Because," said the hunger artist, lifting his head a little and, with his lips pursed as if for a kiss, speaking right into the supervisor's ear so that he wouldn't miss anything, "because I couldn't find a food which I enjoyed. If had found that, believe me, I would not have made a spectacle of myself and would have eaten to my heart's content, like you and everyone else."
<br>—Franz Kafka, <i>The Hunger Artist</i> (translated by Ian Johnston)

"But Gregor fully recognized that it was not just consideration for him which was preventing a move (for he could have been transported easily in a suitable box with a few air holes); the main thing holding the family back from a change in living quarters was far more their complete hopelessness and the idea that they had been struck by a misfortune like no one else in their entire circle of relatives and acquaintances." —Franz Kafka, <i>The Metamorphosis</i> (translated by Ian Johnston)

"Finally, in a low whisper, he said, 'I think I might be a terrible person.' For a split second I believed him—I thought he was about to confess a crime, maybe a murder. Then I realized that we all think we might be terrible people. But we only reveal this before asking someone to love us. It is a kind of undressing."
—Miranda July, <i>The First Bad Man</i>

"Nothing is more paralyzing than the idea of limitless possibilities. The idea that you can do anything is absolutely terrifying." —Austin Kleon, <i>Steal Like An Artist</i>
<br>"I am free and that is why I am lost." —Franz Kafka

"...In spite of his present unhappy and hateful appearance, Gregor was a member of the family, something one should not treat as an enemy, and that it was, on the contrary, a requirement of family duty to suppress one's aversion and to endure—nothing else, just endure." —Franz Kafka, <i>The Metamorphosis</i> (translated by Ian Johnston)

"Once you've taken a few punches and realize you're not made of glass, you don't feel alive unless you're pushing yourself as far as you can go."
—Lexi Alexander, dir. <i>Green Street Hooligans</i>, 2005
