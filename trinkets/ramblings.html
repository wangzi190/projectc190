[11.25.24] I think it'd do me a lot of good to quit worrying about the organization and minute details of this site, and think more about just making things and having fun with it with the site as an afterthought. You'd think working on the site is a fun creative endeavour (and I don't exactly disagree with that) but at times I can't help but feel that it limits me.

[11.11.24] Studying computer science predominantly because of academic interest past the year 2021 literally feels like [Can You Hear The Music - Oppenheimer OST.mp3]

[11.08.24] I went down somewhat of a YouTube rabbithole today and found a video shot presumably at Rainfurrest 2015. The music booming in the background sounded a lot like the stuff I listen to while coding or doing my math homework sometimes (Not trying to be quirky, it seriously helps me focus!). Maybe I'm destined not to go to raves, it'll just put me in the mood for C programming.

[11.06.24] I think I'm starting to understand why researchers have trouble explaining their work to people who are not researchers. I'm able to sum up the things I've learned reasonably well for the paper I'm working on right now, but I honestly have no clue whether someone completely new to this topic would be able to comprehend it. Insert that <a href="https://xkcd.com/2501" target="_blank">xkcd comic</a> here (Though I certainly don't consider myself an expert).

[11.03.24] Not sure if it's just me, but I kind of hate the word "implement". It is unfortunately sometimes the most sensible word to use, though. I think I feel somewhat similarly about the word "utilize". It's fine if you use it once in a while for variety, but holy shit please don't be allergic to just saying the word "use" it's okay I promise.

[10.30.24] I feel like I have a relatively high propensity for being a doomer NEET, so I'm trying to capitalize off of my preexisting interest in computers to thrive in academia to at least avoid needing to find work at Torment Nexus Inc. straight out of undergrad... is what I'd say if I was being utterly filterless when someone asks me about what's going on in my life.
