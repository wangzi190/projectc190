I went to the Computer History Museum as part of a short trip to NorCal earlier this summer. I've been wanting to go see it for a some time now, so this was super exciting :D
<br><br>My takeaways are:
<ul>
<li>Seeing all the computers you've only seen in outdated books and on Wikipedia in real life has to be one of the sickest experiences ever.</li>
<li>I definitely have a newfound appreciation for the quality of the resources I've used to learn about computer history, particularly <i>Computers: The Life Story of a Technology</i>, which may as well have been the museum compressed into a book.</li>
<li>I may just be a nerd, but in my opinion 2 hours was <i>not</i> enough time to look through 20 exhibits. I wish I'd gotten to spend more time in the later exhibits, particularly Computers & Creativity, because I ended up missing a couple things I'd been looking forward to seeing. Eventually, I'd like to go again.</li>
</ul>
In the order of how I viewed them in the museum, here are some of my favorite machines and other artifacts, which I photographed personally:
<br><br>IBM 1401 Demo Room

<br>I didn't get to see this machine in action, but it was still pretty awesome to just look at it. If you want to visit CHM, please have more foresight than me and plan your visit when demos are running :')
<br><br>Army-grade Enigma machine and Colossus tape pulley
<br><a href="/images/for-posts/chm/enigma_machine.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/for-posts/chm/enigma_machine.png" width="412px"></a>
<br>You can tell that this one is army-grade because commercial Enigma machines did not have the plugboard.
<br><br>Working reconstruction of the Atanasoff-Berry computer

<br>It looks just like the last known photo of the original computer before it was dismantled.
<br><br>Atlas logic module
<br><a href="/images/for-posts/chm/atlas_module.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/for-posts/chm/atlas_module.png" width="412px"></a>
<br>Check out the label. Cool, right? The Atlas was definitely one of my favorite computers to read about.
<br><br>1981 IBM PC
<br><a href="/images/for-posts/chm/ibm_pc.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/for-posts/chm/ibm_pc.png" width="412px"></a>
<br>This one is so iconic I can't leave it out.
<br><br>Altair 8800
<br><a href="/images/for-posts/chm/altair_8800.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/for-posts/chm/altair_8800.png" width="412px"></a>
<br>The Altair was marketed as "the first desktop computer kit", and it became a hit with tech hobbyists after being featured in the 1975 edition of <i>Popular Electronics</i>.
<br><br>Jack Kilby's notebook
<br><a href="/images/for-posts/chm/kilby_notebook.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/for-posts/chm/kilby_notebook.png" width="412px"></a>
<br>Even if it's just a replica, I still found this very cool because it made me feel a little more connected to this brilliant engineer whose contributions I've only read about.
<br><br>All in all, the Computer History Museum is hands down one of my most favorite museums and I'd love to go see it again some day.
