As of now, I'm just over a month away from college, so I figured I'd reflect and lay out some goals.
<br>Basically, I'm starting this thing I call a "study log" with the objective of developing better habits. I'll never share grades or scores of any kind, only describe what I've realized makes for more efficient studying through trial and error.
<br>For now, I'm not prioritizing studying, but I do want to work on my everyday habitsâ€”like retaining a healthy sleep schedule, for example. Working on these habits will make me in better shape for studying, anyways. I've written down some specific goals for myself, and I'll update this post each week with a short reflection on how well I met them.
