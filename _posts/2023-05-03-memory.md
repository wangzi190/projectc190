<br><br><b>Concept Notes</b>
<br><br>
A combinational circuit is one whose output does not depend on the value of the previous output, whereas a sequential circuit is one whose output does. Computer memory is inherently time-dependent because data must be retained over time. So, it is built with sequential logic gates.
<br><br><b>Project Notes</b>
<br><br>The following describes major ideas I considered while writing the HDL for the register, memory, and program counter chips specified in <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/project03" target="_blank"><u>N</u>and2Tetris Project 03</a>.

<br><br>How the RAM chip functions
<br><br>Building larger RAM chips recursively
