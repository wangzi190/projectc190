<h6><b>8.1 2D Arrays</b></h6>
A 2D array is an array where each element has two associated values. Here is an example:<br>
int[][] myArray = { {1, 2}, {3, 4} };<br>
System.out.println(myArray[0][1]); // output: 2
<h6><b>8.1 Traversing 2D Arrays</b></h6>
Accessing elements of a 2D array is done as shown above. To traverse the elements of a 2D array, it is most practical to use a nested loop, which loops through each value in each element for each element.
