Since it's break, I'm taking the time to prepare properly for school. Often, I'll mess up somewhere and that'll snowball, so I think preparation will do me a lot of good, you know?<br>
After finally cleaning my desk, and organizing class materials into a binder, I tried getting through three stats assignments. They're not difficult, but I still have to be careful. If I'm just not interested, I can mess up no matter how easy something technically is. But on the flipside, if I am interested in something, I do really well in it.<br>
I have an issue of telling myself I need to get through all my work in one breath. Next time, I should just delegate myself a breakâ€”and I mean a <i>real</i> break. I can't be berating myself about laziness or anything.<br>
I know it's real odd for a high school senior to still be going over this kind of stuff, but in the past, I'd beat myself up too much to ever be able to reflect like this. I think this is good growth, especially since college is going to be much harder.<br>
Oh, also, I've got college application deadlines coming up. The hard part about those is just starting; I tend to get intimidated out of doing college related tasks. I do finish everything, just not in the most timely way, to put it gently. Admittedly, it's much easier to do apps for schools I particularly like. So, maybe doing some research on the schools I'm applying for will spark interest, and motivate me to make my best effort on my applications.<br>
