title: Messaging in art

I tend to dislike artwork whose message is so direct that it's practically propagandistic. This might seem overly critical, but it's more of a reflection of my own taste rather than somebody else's artistry: The other day, I saw a drawing of a TV with an outstretched hand protruding from its screen, and felt almost like it was a waste of the artists' skill to draw something like that. At least for me, I want to create pieces that move people in such a way that it prompts them to think in multiple perspectives. I think the concepts that I'm playing with at the moment might be able to achieve that.<br>
I don't know if this even makes sense, but I guess what I'm getting at is all sides of an argument exist for a reason. Often, there is "objectively true" logic to every argument, but the premises on which the logic is built upon are why somebody would disagree with that argument. I don't want to put out a piece that frames a situation so specifically it leaves no room for questioning and critical thought.
