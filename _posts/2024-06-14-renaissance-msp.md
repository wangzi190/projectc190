After over a year, I'm glad to announce that I've finally added new drawings to <a href="/drawings.html" target="_blank">/drawings.html</a> :') I often struggle with creating "full" pieces t̶h̶a̶t̶ I̶'m̶ a̶l̶s̶o̶ h̶a̶p̶p̶y̶ w̶i̶t̶h, so populating this page will take a while, sorry.

<br><br>Anyways, I thought might as well upload some process pics of the new drawings, because I did for some of the older ones.
<br><br>Here's a few of the first piece, a rendition of Da Vinci's <i>La Scapigliata</i> in MS Paint.

<br>I kind of surprised myself drawing this, to be honest. I fleshed out most of the major details (i.e. the face, and some of the hair and background) in just 2 days. I was extremely focused on it too; it was great.
<br><br>And here's what the second piece, a drawing of a pigeon and olive branch, was originally going to look like.

<br>I felt like the bird(s) didn't match the background very well, and that two birds on a plain background looked more awkward than just one. So, I removed the bird on the right, and adjusted the colors so that the subject and background would mesh together better. I also got the idea of drawing an olive branch in white on the color background, which turned out quite nicely.
