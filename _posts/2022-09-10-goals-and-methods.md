My goals and methods for success APCSA and school or life in general are outlined here.

For APCSA:
* I will review and record assignment objectives in my planner at the beginning of each week.
* I will check in with my team when reviewing assignment objectives or project ideas.
* By processing the instructions earlier, I will make starting assignments easier, and can better take advantage of class time.

General help methods:
* I record each of my tasks by category (i.e. school subject) and priority. I also mark each task with a percentage out of 100 (100% = my work for the day is complete) showing how big or difficult it is, so that I can make an accurate assessment of how much work I have or have not done.
* I list tasks by part, and assign a number of points to each part. As I work, I count points on my abacus.

I think happy people have to have clearly defined goals which work for them. That way, they can find ample time for their responsibilities and life's necessities (fun, breaks, etc.) and feel good about themselves.

For my personal happiness, I want to better manage time so that I have time for all my interests.
