<h6><b>6.1 Array Creation and Access</b></h6>
An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. Declaring an array in Java goes as follows:<br>
int[] myArray = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};<br>
And accessing the elements in an array looks like this:<br>
int arrayElement = myArray[0];
<h6><b>6.2 Traversing Arrays</b></h6>
To "traverse" an array is to use an iterative statement to access all the elements in an array. See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arrays_loop.asp" target="_blank"><u>t</u>his</a> link for additional information.
<h6><b>6.3 Enhanced for Loop for Arrays</b></h6>
An enhanced for loop, also known as a "for-each" loop, is an iterative statement specifically used to traverse arrays. Its syntax goes as follows:<br>
for (variableType variableName : arrayName) {}
<h6><b>6.4 Developing Algorithms Using Arrays</b></h6>
Arrays may be used to store data a programmer wishes to use recurringly in their program, and accessed when necessary with an iterative statement.
