I might've overdone it the other week.

I had a big coding project, 2 more midterms, and a couple homework assignments. Though my to-do list wasn't exactly teeming with tasks, the handful of things I needed to do were worth pretty significant portions of my grade. I also hadn't done as well as I would've liked on the first exam for one of my classes, so I was determined to make up for it this time.

I got up at around 5am each day, put on metal music, chugged an energy drink, and got to work immediately, only diverting my focus to haphazardly shovel chips into my mouth as a lousy excuse for a meal. And the thing is, I worked incredibly well for long hours. I was so intensely concentrated that I felt that it'd cost much more of my effort to break focus than it would to keep going. And on top of that, I was having fun too. There was no bug I couldn't fix, no math problem I couldn't solve. Everything I'd previously been unclear on in class became intuitive after the time and effort I'd spent carefully reasoning my way through it, and it felt great.

In fact, it felt so great that I couldn't even anticipate the oncoming crash I was going to experience. I envisioned myself dedicating most of my weekend to working on the vision paper I'd met with my professor earlier in the week to discuss. It feels ridiculous to admit now, but I genuinely thought I could draft the entirety of my part before Monday.

When the weekend came, I didn't exactly feel bad, just not willing to do anything. I thought it'd pass in a few days time, but it didn't. For the next two weeks or so, I felt very hazy, and needed much more time to rest than usual. I fell asleep in my evening lecture yesterday despite having slept 7-8 hours. I found myself frequently spending time mindlessly listening to music, browsing the Web, or straight up staring at the wall and zoning out. Hours would pass, but when I looked back, I wouldn't be able to recall what I did. Though I could still get around to all my homework and classes in spite of this, I felt deeply disappointed that I couldn't even spend my free time doing things I enjoyed consciously and deliberately.

I guess dubbing this a "productivity hangover" is a little misleading. I'm not referring to the godawful corpo idea of "productivity"; I'm a student, why would I care? It's more a period of time where I struggle to even muster the energy to do things like read a book or watch TV. I can still tend to my barest obligations, which as of now is schoolwork in my two favorite topics, CS and math, so it's nothing I can't manage. I just wonder why it's so hard for me to adopt a more moderate approach to taking on all this.

To reframe this more positively, I feel grateful that in college, I can still get the top grades with this eccentric "work cycle" of mine. I'm never punished for getting struck with motivation to work ahead nor am I punished for having off days (or even off weeks), and I feel that I'm better able to take things at my own pace, whatever that pace may be.

But I don't know, it's weird, really. I probably appear incredibly well put-together and functional to others, but I don't feel that way internally at all. Maybe it's just that I'm too acclimated to myself to reasonably gauge how knowledgeable I am or how good I am at something, but even then, acknowledging that doesn't assure me much. I feel like my strengths only make up for my immense incompetence in things nobody else seems to struggle with. <i>Yeah, I'm barely functional as a human being sometimes, but surely my knack for computers absolves me of this?</i>
