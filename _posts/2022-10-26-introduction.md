Recently started reading Michael Sipser's <i>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</i>. This section of my blog is where I will be keeping my notes and thoughts. I have yet to develop a concise and helpful notetaking system for studying this topic, so pardon me if these are clunky. The below is simply transferred from what I've written in Google Docs.

0.1 Automata, Computability, and Complexity
* The three traditionally central areas of computation theory are complexity, computability, and automata.
* <b>Complexity</b>: <i>What makes some problems computationally hard, and others computationally easy?</i>
    * Discoveries in computation complexity have furthered the field of cryptography, which demands that problems are computationally difficult
* <b>Computability</b>: <i>What makes some problems solvable, and others unsolvable?</i>
* <b>Automata</b>: (as defined by the book) <i>Automata theory deals with the definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation.</i>
    * <i>What is a computer?</i>
