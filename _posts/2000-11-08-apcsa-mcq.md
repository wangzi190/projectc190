<br>Realizing that the key difference between AP CSP and AP CSA multiple choice questions is that AP CSA tests you on specifics that you'd only be able to know if you were accustomed to using Java. I found myself looking up various syntax and functions in case I'd forgotten the details.
<br><br>I got two questions wrong. Below is the first.

Here, I selected option C instead of the correct option, option B. This was because (embarrassingly) I forgot arrays start at zero. Running sum += key[i] would skip the first item in the array because int i starts as 1.<br><br>
Now for the second incorrect answer:

Here, I selected "I only" (option A) instead of the correct option, "I and II only" (option D). It looks like I did not read carefully enough, because the correct answer should have been obvious. Running code snippet II can also help a user determine if one box can fit into another, seeing as it returns "true" if the box is less than the width, height, and depth than the other. So, "true true true" would mean the box has a smaller width, heigh, and depth than the other, and can therefore fit into the other box.
