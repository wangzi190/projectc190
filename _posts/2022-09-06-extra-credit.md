Alumi Presentation Notes

Hi, these are my presentation notes. They are just for my reference, but here they are in case they are necessary for the credit.

I also stayed back to talk 1-on-1 with a few of the presenters about what learning computer science is like in college, and think I got some pretty good insight. But ultimately, the best insight will be experiencing all of these things for myself. Thank you for arranging this presentation, I found it inspirational and fun!

Computer science struggles 

Frustration with debugging; being disciplined enough to patiently solve problems
When entering computer science, donâ€™t worry about what other people are doing and just stick to your own work and projects (i.e. have your own path set out and just do the best you can)
Transition from coding in high school to background and theory in college
Frustration with syntax distracting from thinking about logic, finding motivation
Finding a specific project to apply compsci concepts to
Difficult getting started sometimes
Lack of rigid structure in advanced computer science

PBL Scenarios?

Make the most of any project opportunities you have, communicate with team members effectively
College first few years is usually general education with large class sizes (very little 1-on-1 attention from teachers if any) Study and do PBL in groups
Ask lots of questions

Applying CS if not in CS?

Writing a script to do boring or repetitive tasks
MatLab requires some computer science knowledge
Using CAD software (you can program the analysis and stress test in CAD)
Applying problem solving logic instead of specifically doing code
Computer science knowledge helps in high level math classes
People using Jupyter notebooks for their technical papers (graphs, interactive components, text)
CS even in stats and psychology

Internships?
Take your internship stuff seriously
LG internship working with APIs/internal API
Technical drawing revisions and wiring diagrams, website for Northrop Grumman flight data

Data visualization
Pathfinding algorithms

A lot of companies hire in Sept or November for the following summer

School/GPA are secondary to personal projects and internships etc. because your work is what will truly set you apart or testify how strong of a candidate you are
