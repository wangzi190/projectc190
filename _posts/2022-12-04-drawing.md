I'm trying to train myself off of excessive perfectionism (in all sorts of things, really, but especially in drawing). I've also been wanting to develop some solid techniques for drawing birds. So, I started a new piece, and dove into coloring after no more than a few minutes of sketching. Ironically, I get a lot more out of drawing by forcing myself to "do" more than "think." I guess it's because if otherwise, I let thinking get in the way of doing. Here are my takeaways from today's work:
<ul>
  <li>Think of each feather as a brush stroke which can later be accentuated with pencils. Also, keep your pencils sharper.</li>
  <li>The points at which two different layers of feathers meet should be clearly defined so that the wings look cleaner.</li>
  <li>Dark and light areas should be carefully planned so that the bird does not simply look like a mess of detail.</li>
</ul>

<br>I want to proceed by continuing to draw "mindlessly" like I have today, and afterwards consider what I can adjust about my process for next time.
