<br>I might actually like it now. I think it looked kind of disjointed before because I'd started by drawing the wings of a secretary bird, and then tried to mold it into a pigeon. I was also upset with the boring colors and lack of background, so this is an improvement.
<br>This piece is mostly for technical practice. I'm still wrestling with the concepts for a line of more thoughtful pieces, and working on fanart :^)
