Algorithms to Live By is a popular science book featuring a rich variety of striking real-world examples, from the fall of the Berlin Wall to tennis tournaments, that illustrate the ubiquity of the principles of computer science.

Having been taking an intermediate programming course for school, I read this book at a pretty opportune time. Not only was it generally very interesting, but it was a very welcome break from tedious programming assignments, and helped keep me motivated. More importantly, the book also convinced me to think of computer science as a practically universal mode of logic, which can show you new ways of thinking about all kinds of things in the world.

If you want to become more familiar with computer science, I'd highly encourage you to read this. The authors make analogies to everyday endevours such as sorting a bookshelf or inviting guests to your home, which helps a lot with understanding. On the other hand, even if you already understand every concept described in the book, I'd recommend it neverthelessâ€”the sheer volume and variety of connections the authors make to human nature and society is bound to show you new perspectives.

In fact, I wouldn't strictly consider this book a computer science book, by any means, because it also describes what I guess you could call the philosophical extensions of computer algorithms. The book often struck me more as multi-disciplinary, with roots in computer science. It may not be to everyone's taste, but I found it pretty illuminating.
