It's fun stitching a bunch of references together instead of drawing directly off of one. The face is pretty much all improv, which I guess is pretty good given that I struggle with less-than-realistic faces. I don't know; I tend to find realism or semi-realism easier because it entails making careful observations of what you can already see.

<br>I was also thinking that for next time, I should start a drawing with a non-white color background. It'd influence my color choices when drawing the subject, and would certainly be more interesting than a character on a blank background.
<br>Oh, and this is a work in progress by the way! I just like to have several pieces going at once, so I can't get too obsessed with just one and end up burning myself out haha
