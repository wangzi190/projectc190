<h6><b>3.1 Boolean Expressions</b></h6>
A boolean is a variable type that may only be 1 of 2 values: true or false. Boolean expressions are statements that can only return either true or false. For example, x == 5 (x is equal to 5) is a boolean expression because it is a statement that can either be true or false. You can use boolean expressions in loops so that the program knows when to terminate the loop.
<h6><b>3.2 if Statements and Control Flow</b></h6>
If statements are control structures where certain blocks of code will run so long as its attributed boolean expression is true. For example, if (x == 5) {code here} will run if x is equal to 5.
<h6><b>3.3 if-else Statements</b></h6>
If-else statements are an if statement with an "else" condition included. Basically, in the case that none of the "if" conditions hold true, the code block in the "else" bracket will run.
<h6><b>3.4 else if Statements</b></h6>
Else-if statements are an if-else statement with another "if" or set of "if" statements in its "else" bracket. In the case that none of the "if" conditions hold true, the code block runs the "if" statement or set of "if" statements in the "else" bracket of the if-else statement.
