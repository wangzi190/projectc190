Because Java is an object-oriented programming language, data involved in Java programs are associated with classes and objects. A class is a "blueprint" for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class. For example, if "animal" was a class, "bird" is an instance of that class.

Classes and objects are associated with attributes and methods. An attribute is data attributed to a class or object, while a method is a procedure associated with a class or object. Generally, a class will include attributes or methods which the object "inherits." A Java method must be declared within a class.
