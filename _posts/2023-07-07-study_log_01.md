As of now, I'm just over a month away from college, so I figured I'd do some reflection and lay out some goals in my study log.
<br>I'm starting this thing I'm calling a "study log" with the objective of developing healthier studying and general life habits.
<br>never share grades or scores (it’s about developing healthy habits, not grades or scores)
<br>generally only post when 1) there’s something important or notable about your habits/etc. from lately you’d like to remember, and 2) you’ve met some stressful deadlines and want to reflect on what you did good or bad, how you can improve, how you feel, etc.
