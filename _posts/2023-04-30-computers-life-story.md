Managed to find this gem among a heap of depricated tech books my school library was giving away for free.

<br><br>I appreciate it for the fact that it explains connections between eventsâ€”such as how some machines inspired the creations of others. It reads like the multitudes of computer history facts I've read on Wikipedia strung into a neat story. The content is organized by concept rather than by time, but paired with the timeline in the beginning of the book, it makes a lot of sense. I also like how the book begins with descriptions of early counting or navigation devices and mathematics, which I don't usually see acknowledged as relevant to the origins of the computer.
<br><br>With that said, I didn't like how some disputed information, most notably Alan Turing's "suicide," was presented as factual. It lead me to wonder what other information in the book could be inaccurate. However, this book was published in 2005, and as far as I know, the nature of Alan Turing's death wasn't disputed until it was called into question by Jack Copeland in 2012. So, I gave it the benefit of the doubt.
<br><br>It should also be noted that, because this book is focused on computer <i>history</i>, it doesn't provide ample detail on the adjacent topics it references. Additionally, the language is clunky at times, and, for a published book, there is an absurd amount of typos. Really, the most compelling thing about the book is that it organizes many events and ideas into a comprehensible sequence, and is a great pointer for topics to do additional reading on.
<br><br>All in all, I enjoyed it.
