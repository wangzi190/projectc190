<h6><b>1.1 Why Programming? Why Java?</b></h6>
Java is object oriented; in Java, data is comparmentalized as objects.
<h6><b>1.2 Variables and Data Types</b></h6>
Java features both primitive and nonprimitive data types. Primitives are those built into the programming language (such as int, byte, short, long, etc.), whereas nonprimitives are those that are user defined (Array, Class, String, and Interface).
<h6><b>1.3 Expressions and Assignment Statements</b></h6>
An expression is a construct of variables, operators, and method calls which evaluates to a single value. An assignment statement is a line of code which "assigns" a value to a variable (like "x = 10;" for example).
<h6><b>1.4 Compound Assignment Operators</b></h6>
+=, -=, *=, /=, %= (x += 5 is the equivalent of x = x+5, x -= 5 is the equivalent of x = x-5, and so on) and &=, ^=, |=, <<=, >>=, >>>=
<br>Bitwise operators take the bit pattern of the variable and change it accordingly. See the last code cell of U1 HW for more :)
<h6><b>1.5 Casting and Ranges of Variables</b></h6>
In Java, type casting is used to change variable type. "Narrowing" (i.e. changing to a type that stores fewer bits) must be done manually, whereas "widening" (i.e. changing to a type that stores more bits) is done automatically when a smaller size type is passed to a larger size.
