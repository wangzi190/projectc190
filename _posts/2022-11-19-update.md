I've been working to get parts of this site up and running properly more than I've been adding content. Right now I'm looking at JS and CSS animations to spice things up, and I'm thinking maybe a guestbook or music player too. Don't hold me to all of this, by the way. I have ideas I know for sure I'll be adding, but you don't get to hear about them (unless through documentation) until they're done.
