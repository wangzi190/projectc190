Hey, it's been a while.

You'll probably recall that from January to June of this year I made myself write a monthly post about my life. In the time that I've stopped, I guess I couldn't really see the point of it anymore. I feel like I'm now able to casually write for this blog instead of sounding strangely stilted (Maybe it's just in my head, but I feel like my writing style is still trying to escape the grip of shitty English classes), so I don't think I need to hold myself to the monthly post thing anymore. Though it wasn't exactly my original intention, writing monthly helped me a lot with writing for my site in general, and I feel like I sound more like myself now.

Accordingly, I will probably just write whatever, whenever I feel like it now instead of continuing to write monthly. I've also since gotten busier, so I'm not sure it's viable anymore, anyway.

In any case, school has since started and it's going pretty well. I think I've become much more self-assured and able to self-regulate since last year. I was much more of a disaster than I let onto before, sure I got good grades but I don't think that's worth <i>constant</i> anxiety over every Canvas notification or whatnot. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a little too nonchalant now, but I figure I shouldn't overthink it if I'm still definitely doing well.

I guess I've never let onto this either, but I was never a good student until college, so being able to manage school in any capacity was unthinkable to me just a few years ago. To be honest, I feel like I'd probably be dropping out if I'd chosen to study anything other than computer science, but I digress.

Things are going so well lately that I'm terrified to jinx it. It just so happened that a new professor is teaching one of my classes, and that he's looking for undergraduates to work on research with. All I did was ask him what I could do, and over the last few weeks or so we've been coordinating a really cool project together. I will likely not publicize much of it here, but basically, it's a security and cryptography-related project that involves a bunch of CS and math things I've been wanting to get into, and I'm very excited about it.

In a way, I'm also relieved because I've been feeling like I'm hitting a wall in regards to how much I'm learning from school. A lot of what I'm covering in my classes right now (at least, in my CS classes) are things I already had some foundation of in high school because I don't know, I was nuts I guess. As much as I enjoy scouring the Internet and reading PDFs and the like, I think I've been wishing for something bigger, and that this is that thing. Maybe that's a little dramatic, but in any case, I really hope this research goes somewhere.

Aside from all this, I wouldn't say there is much else going on in my life, not on a day-to-day, moment-to-moment basis anyway. I study, do my homework, read research papers, listen to gritty music on the late bus; it's pretty much the same most days, but I still enjoy it. I've also been making more friends (Hi, if you're reading this), which is a pleasant change from last school year when I pretty much spent months in isolation.

With that said, I'm still kind of getting a grip on my new workload, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't difficult sometimes. I've found that I can't have too many consecutive productive days without getting something I've dubbed a "productivity hangover". I'll just spend an entire day mindlessly seeking dopamine hits from stuff like shitty mobile games with relentless pop-ups prompting you to crack open your wallet. I am trying to funnel my downtime into things that I find more interesting and enriching, but I can't say I've been very successful at that so far.

I have made significant progress on my MIPS Tetris project, though! It was a real blast to work on, but I somewhat drag my feet when it comes to writing about it, even if I know it's for the best that I document my work. The next blog update on that will come out... eventually.

Ah, I was also going to say a little something about Halloween, because it's coming up and I'm not sure I'll be able to update again before then. I used to be really into Halloween but now I just don't have the energy. I have no clue what's in the water but for some reason every professor thinks we need a ton of stuff to do leading up to October 31st specifically. I don't think I'm going to get around to it, but for the record, I'd like to dress up as Patrick Bateman and have fake blood splattered down the side of my face. Maybe I'll show up to class like that on some random other day.

This is probably my most honest journal post to date. Anyways, until next time.
