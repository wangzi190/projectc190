May was so uneventful that I'm not sure what to say about it, but for consistency's sake, I'll try to throw something out anyway.
<br><br>I moved out of my school dorm at the beginning of the month, and then kind of did whatever at home. Some time during the month, I revamped some site pages and code, started working on an Enigma machine simulator in C, and got weirdly knowledgeable about Jojo Siwa's backstory via YouTube video essays (Please don't talk to me about it, I've heard enough). I also got halfway through like two books.
