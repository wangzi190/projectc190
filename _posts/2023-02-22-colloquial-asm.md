title: Assembly in colloquial terms

I've never really thought to discuss the content I read about because I figured, why rewrite what is definitely already written?
<br>But now, I'm thinking it'd probably be of some use to restate important points in a way that's comprehensible to people without computer science background, so... here I go.
<br>Programming languages such as Java or Python are called "high level languages," which means that they shroud the underlying processes of the computer in <i>high</i> obscurity. For example, when using high level programming languages, you probably won't be thinking about the memory addresses at which you store information on the computer.
<br>Assembly language, on the other hand, is a <i>low</i> level programming language. Whereas commands in high level languages embody logical concepts (e.g. "if [this event] occurs, execute [this code]"), assembly language machine instructions correlate directly to the functions of a processor chip. So, assembly machine instructions can actually be translated into the sequences 1s and 0s read by the computer processor. The data involved in assembly programs are also sequences of 1s and 0s.
<br>Of course, the logistics of processor functions, memory organization, or data representation might vary across different types of processor chips, which is why different families of processors (think Intel, ARM, or MIPS) have their own assembly languages.
<br>Anyways, maybe I'm just a massive geek, but I think assembly language is definitely worth learning. I used to wonder about the specifics of computational processes, so I guess I just like it because it answers my questions haha TT
