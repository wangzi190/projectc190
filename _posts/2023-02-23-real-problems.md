It's been ingrained in me to think that many modern issues are because of phones or other technologies invented in the last generation or so. I don't want to deny that that can be the case sometimes, but I notice I tend to be dismissive of my or other peoples' issues because <i>surely it's because of the Internet</i>, or something like that.
Lately though, it's dawned on me that whether or not an issue is caused by modern technology is irrelevant in discussing whether or not it is real or valid.
Our precedents for what "real" problems are were set in a world that no longer exists.
