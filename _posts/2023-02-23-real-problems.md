title: '"Real" problems'
categories: personal

It's been engrained in me to think that many modern issues are because of phones or other technologies invented in the last generation. I don't want to deny that that can be the case sometimes, but I notice I tend to be dismissive of my or other peoples' issues because <i>surely it's because of the Internet</i>, or something like that.
Lately though, it's dawned on me that whether or not an issue is caused by modern technology is actually irrelevent in discussing whether or not it is real or valid. Maybe it's not the worst problem there is, but it doesn't have to be to matter.
Our precedents for what "real" problems are were set in a world that no longer exists.
