<h6><b>4.1 while Loops</b></h6>
While loops are loops (or more broadly and formally, "control structures") where the loop will run until the specified condition is no longer true. For example, while (i != 0) {code here} will run so long as variable i does not equal 0.
<h6><b>4.2 for Loops</b></h6>
For loops are loops (aka "control structures") where a "counter" variable is declared, and then incremented for each execution of the loop. The loop will terminate once the specific boolean expression is no longer true. For example, for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {code here} starts with the counter at 0, adds 1 to the counter for every execution of the loop, and will terminate once i < 5 is no longer true.
<h6><b>4.3 Developing Algorithms Using Strings</b></h6>
"Strings" (e.g. "apple" and "banana") are groups of "characters" (e.g. "a" and "p") that can be traversed, split, etc. in code. Think .length(), .charAt(), .substring(), and other such functions.
<h6><b>4.4 Nested Iteration</b></h6>
Nested iteration refers to when an interative control structure is "nested" within another interative control structure (a loop within a loop).
<h6><b>4.5 Informal Code Analysis</b></h6>
Informal code analysis is done when you are writing a program and want to see how the program is running step by step. An example of such analysis is writing statements to print the value of certain variables at certain points of the program. Also, some code editors include a debugger where you can run sections of a code at a time to see what they do individually, and similar such start/stop debugging tools.
