title: On old computers
categories: personal

I think a part of the reason why I like old computers so much is that they're symbolic of a time in which people had the chance to form their senses of self separate from technology, whereas by the time I was born, the digital world had already been established.<br>
There's also just this very particular type of mystique that I associate with computers, where in order to eliminate it I need to understand not only the inner workings of the computer but also its origins.<br>
(Alternative, funnier explanation: I like old computers because they bring me back to better timesâ€”when I didn't exist.)
