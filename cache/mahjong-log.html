    Why Japanese mahjong?
    <br>Put simply, more people play it, so I'm able to play it online whenever I want.
    Also, though I haven't really played other variants, I can infer that riichi's emphasis on defensive strategy probably makes it more interesting.
    <hr>
    As of now, I'd say I have a decent understanding of tile efficiency as well as defense strategies like suji and fundamental discard reading (think Riichi Book 1 type stuff).
    I think my defense could use a lot more work, though, because it doesn't feel intuitive enough for me to take in everything quickly, and I can miss important details.
    And though I often understand all the strategies the announcers discuss when I watch mahjong tournaments, the players actually seem psychic sometimes.
    <br><br>
    I'm ranked Adept III in Mahjong Soul and my stats look something like this. So, there's lots of improvement to be made!

    <br><img src="/images/jong/stats_2.png" width="590px">
    <br>My win rate and deal-in rate have been gradually inching away from each other, so I'm hoping to continue that trend strong.
    Also, if you're wondering, my player ID is 117518950. Feel free to add me.
    <br><br>I usually play mahjong in short bursts and then ignore it for months. You'd think that wouldn't be great if my goal is to improve, but I've actually found it somewhat helpful because when I return to the game it's with fresh eyes.
    Also, I don't want to be excessively fixated on my stats; I'll just do my thing and naturally I will get a bit better with each session.

    <br>From playing and reviewing logs a little today I think I'm probably too hesitant to full fold when I'm 2nd or 3rd place.
    I should probably read up on defense and deliberately train it instead of getting too caught up in tile efficiency and maintaining tenpai when I have something to lose.
    <br><br>Unrelated, but I'm also pissed because I had a solid +70 on my rank points, but lost it because I queued up for another game and it simply refused to connect. Then I quickly got temp banned for "AFK activity", which made joining the game impossible even if I tried. Rip my progress toward Expert I.

    <br>Sat down to play a few games today and ranked up to Adept III! I've been on the verge of ranking up for some time now so I'm super happy that I finally did.
    I'll look at my logs later I guess lol.
    <br>Edit: One of my logs showed A- to S- rankings for all rounds with the exception of one D+ round, where I was playing stupid careful defense to avoid dealing in lmao. Might have to ask about that, but as far as I know I probably didn't blunder too badly.

    <br><img src="/images/jong/maka_1.png" width="590px">
    <br>For some reason, I keep getting donked by Maka over tossing dragons instead of other floating tiles.
    <br>I think 9m is the recommended discard here because though both it and green dragon are quite difficult to pair up, pairing up green dragon gives my hand a yaku and more value, whereas 9m would do neither.
    However, as the round goes on, I should definitely get rid of any floating dragon tiles for efficiency and potentially as a defensive maneuver.
    I guess 1s is also a reasonable discard option at the moment, but not especially recommended to help the possibility of a pure straight?

    <br><img src="/images/jong/maka_2.jpg" width="590px">
    <br>I wasn't sure why kan is apparently the move here, because I usually decide against it unless I'm sorely losing.
    It looks like because the player across from me has 2 open calls, they are likely to be in tenpai, and their last block is likely to be incomplete because I hold 6 58s, making 8s a dangerous tile.
    I can see the rationale, but I think I just didn't kan because I didn't want the player across from me to potentially gain hand value.
    I also sometimes forget that after a kan, I draw again from the dead wall, so kan'ing won't mess up my hand as much as I think it does, especially not in this situation.
