    <i>Why riichi (Japanese) mahjong?</i>
    <br>Put simply, more people play it, so I'm able to play it online whenever I want.
    Also, I like riichi mahjong's emphasis on defensive strategy.

    <u>My player stats</u>
    <br>I'm ranked Adept III in Mahjong Soul and my stats look something like this. So, there's plenty to improve on.
    <br><img src="/images/jong/stats_1.png" width="590px">
    <br><img src="/images/jong/stats_2.png" width="590px">
    <br>I suspect that my 4th rate and deal-in rate are lower than the Detailed Info section states, considering that the Ranking Statistics section, which is based on my last 100 matches, looks a lot better.
    To further support this claim, my win rate and deal-in rate have been steadily inching away from each other the more I play. Though, I guess there's no way to know my "true" stats until I play much more. Anyways, I'm just hoping to continue positive trends.
    <br><br><u>My playstyle</u>
    <br>I'm honestly not sure if I have a distinctive playstyle.
    In general, I'm not very prone to risk because I've noticed that playing stupidly defensive tends to lead to good payout.
    Of course, I'm not immune to lapses of reason either.
    <br><br><u>How I engage with mahjong</u>
    <br>I usually play mahjong in short bursts and then ignore it for up to months. You'd think that wouldn't be great if my goal is to improve, but I've actually found it somewhat helpful because when I return to the game it's with fresh eyes.
    Breaks also prevent me from getting excessively fixated on the stats, and allow me to better focus on the game when I do play.
    <br><br>I also like to watch Mahjong Soul official tournaments, which they post on their YouTube channel.
    <br><br><u>Fun information for fun people</u>
    <br>Favorite yaku: Mixed triple sequence
    <br>Least favorite yaku: Seven pairs
    <br>Other things I like building to in-game, when within reason: Dual pon wait (even better if on honors or terminals), suji trap wait
    <br>Majsoul PID: 117518950 (Add me!)
    <br>Majsoul mains: Sawako, Ichihime
    <br><br>
    Below is where I talk more about mahjong specifics.
    I will try to focus the discussion on strategy and analysis, but I might mention other things sometimes too.

    <br>Something funny I've noticed in Silver Room is that when players call a sequence or triplet that contains terminals, they often hold 2 dragons or round or seat wind tiles they intend to form a triplet with later. (Is this what people mean when they talk about analogue strategy?). If this is the competition we are so making it to Expert.

    [06.05.25]
    <br>From playing and reviewing logs a little today I think I'm probably too hesitant to full fold when I'm 2nd or 3rd place.
    I should probably read up on defense and deliberately train it instead of getting too caught up in tile efficiency and maintaining tenpai when I have something to lose.
    <br><br>Unrelated, but I'm also pissed because I had a solid +70 on my rank points, but lost it because I queued up for another game and it simply refused to connect. Then I quickly got temp banned for "AFK activity", which made joining the game impossible even if I tried...

    <br>Sat down to play a few games today and ranked up to Adept III! I've been on the verge of ranking up for some time now so I'm super happy that I finally did.
    I'll look at my logs later I guess lol.

    <br><img src="/images/jong/maka_1.png" width="590px">
    <br>For some reason, I keep getting donked by Maka over tossing dragons instead of other floating tiles.
    <br>I think 9m is the recommended discard here because though both it and green dragon are quite difficult to pair up, pairing up green dragon gives my hand a yaku and more value, whereas 9m would do neither.
    However, as the round goes on, I should definitely get rid of any floating dragon tiles for efficiency and potentially as a defensive maneuver.
    I guess 1s is also a reasonable discard option at the moment, but not especially recommended to help the possibility of a pure straight?

    <br><img src="/images/jong/maka_2.jpg" width="590px">
    <br>I wasn't sure why kan is apparently the move here, because I usually decide against it unless I'm sorely losing.
    It looks like because the player across from me has 2 open calls, they are likely to be in tenpai, and their last block is likely to be incomplete because I hold 6 58s, making 8s a dangerous tile.
    I can see the rationale, but I think I just didn't kan because I didn't want the player across from me to potentially gain hand value.
    I also sometimes forget that after a kan, I draw again from the dead wall, so kan'ing won't mess up my hand as much as I think it does, especially not in this situation.
