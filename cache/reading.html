        My journey with reading is pretty standard: I went from devouring 500+ page books with ease when I was a little kid, to pretty much never reading anything not strictly assigned to me from school during the pandemic. I created this page because I've been recovering my interest in reading, and I want to further incentivize myself to do it. So, what better way to do that than create a dedicated page for the hobby?

        <summary><i>Right-Wing Women</i> by Andrea Dworkin</summary>
        <div class="review">
            In Right-Wing Women, Dworkin elaborates at length on the dehumanizing mechanisms of patriarchy, and explains why right-wing women accept it for what it is in order to make what they perceive as "the better deal" in a society that does not value women. She thoroughly explains right-wing women's reasoning instead of dismissing them as too stupid to understand the harms of male supremacy, which I found insightful even if I fundamentally disagree. Though some may consider the way she writes to be too charged and vulgar, I find many of the author's articulations about feminist issues, such as the so-called separate-but-equal model and the systematic denial of women's self-actualization and bodily autonomy, to be incredibly on the mark. She is "extreme", but almost never without some element of truth. I think accurately assessing the mass degradation of women under patriarchy necessarily entails some ugly and unsettling language, and that Dworkin used it in a way that is, for the most part, substantive to her argument. I felt so vindicated at her explanations of the social, political, and sexual subjugation of women throughout history as what it was—deliberate cruelty—rather than a natural side effect of war or "woman's nature" or whatnot. The intellectual rigor with which she asserts feminist thought is truly vindicating.
            <br>My problem with this book is mostly with how people use it to defend bioessentialist definitions of womanhood, when really it describes the inherent bioessentialism of the patriarchy without much comment on whether it truthfully defines womanhood—a different question entirely. Even then, Dworkin states verbatim that "feminists propose that women are not their sex" and "no sexual dichotomy is compatible with real liberation". I can acknowledge that I may have done a fairly optimistic, trans-inclusionary reading of this book, but in short, I still firmly believe that radical feminists who defend bioessentialism in evaluating woman's condition often make the fallacies of 1) creating arbitrary restrictions on what defines a woman, excluding people who undergo dehumanizing sex-based subjugation of a similar nature (the trans panic legal strategy is a potent example of this; the brutalization and murder of trans women by men is justified by invoking the idea that they do not align with patriarchal notions of sex) from their evaluation of the sex-class system, and 2) internalizing the idea that male domination and violence is an unavoidable fact of "biology", both of which harm feminist analysis. Contrary to popular belief, I do not think radical feminism inherently opposes transgender rights nor do I think it should, and ultimately, my verdict on this book is that it is great overall but definitely a little dated.

        <summary><i>How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems</i> by Randall Munroe</summary>
        <div class="review">
            This is going to sound like one of those excessively positive reviews they put in the inside covers of books, but I don't care, because I express this from the depths of my soul. This book is simply a masterpiece, the pinnacle of book-entertainment dare I say. It's like science, but with a dose of those delirious conversations you have with your friends where each person says something more absurd than the previous, and before you know it you're all uncontrollably laughing. Each chapter presents a realistic problem and explores a bunch of fun and wacky ways to solve it, with comic illustrations in between. It's lighthearted, delightfully educational, and sometimes unexpectedly deep; there was probably no point in this book where I wasn't thoroughly enjoying it. I learned all sorts of interesting things, from why we need leap seconds in modern timekeeping to how atmospheric nuclear bomb testing affected carbon dating. If you like xkcd, this is an absolute must-read.

        <summary><i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i> by Rebecca Skloot</summary>
        <div class="review">
            I began reading this not knowing anything about HeLa cells, much less the story of the woman behind them, Henrietta Lacks, and this book enlightened me on the subject in a highly descriptive and intimate way. I can infer that most if not all other retellings of this story lack the personal elements that this author was able to tap into to thanks to her unparalleled dedication and care. She spent the course of years earning the trust of the Lacks family, piecing together the story as accurately as possible, and bringing it to life beautifully. Skloot really has a knack for describing people and expressing to you their human-ness; I liked how she described the way Henrietta went out to dance with her friends, how she liked to paint (and repaint) her nails bright red, and how her cancer affected her physically and emotionally over time. I feel like I learned a lot about who she was instead of just what her cells did for modern science (which, because of their sheer importance, is already elaborated on in many other publications anyway). In addition to giving you a meaningful glimpse into Henrietta's life, the book also provides a detailed background of the atrocities committed by medical researchers experimenting on black people, as well as the shockingly poor ethical standards for medical research in general, and trust me, it is horrific. To me, this background really helped put into perspective why the Lacks family were so distrustful, and why Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter, struggled with such severe anxiety and stress not knowing what really happened to her mother. I found it valuable to understand this story based on the thoughts and experiences of the Lacks family, who, in spite of the numerous researchers whose careers exist entirely thanks to the availability and robustness of HeLa, have perhaps the most significant stake in it. I can't help but wonder how my perception might've differed if I first learned about HeLa and Henrietta Lacks from a research perspective.

        <summary><i>Infect Your Friends and Loved Ones</i> by Torrey Peters</summary>
        <div class="review">
            I read this novella while bored one evening. The story premise is pretty interesting; basically, it's set in a post-apocalyptic timeline where a mass contagion prevents people's bodies from producing sex hormones, giving everybody the ability to choose which to sustain themselves with. I expected it to be pretty heavy on worldbuilding due to the subject matter, only instead it was much more character-focused. It's not that that's necessarily bad, but I think the short length of the book meant I had a harder time investing in the characters than I would when reading other ones. There are some pretty hard-hitting excerpts, though, and I like how it's more just raw and honest speculative fiction involving trans perspectives instead of "activism". It's definitely a refreshing read amidst a political landscape that has its priorities skewed, one that threatens to strip away the collective rights of marginalized groups at any perceived misstep.

        <summary><i>Convenience Store Woman</i> by Sayaka Murata</summary>
        <div class="review">
            This book tells the story of a woman who's been working the same dead-end job for 18 years, only it's so much more interesting than that would lead you to believe! The way it manages to depict the mundane setting of a convenience store in a completely new light, that is, from the view of Furukura, who feels that she can only be a functioning member of society within a convenience store, is amazing. I feel like people who think she is "quirky" just cannot comprehend a protagonist who doesn't think exactly like them, because given what the story has established about what kind of person she is, her perspectives and reasoning make a lot of sense. I related to her on the basis of living in a society with similar values, a society that tells women that living and behaving as a "normal" woman is more important than doing what truly fulfills them. Ignoring Furukura's own outlook on her life, the people she knows instead opt to focus on her "weird" mannerisms and the way she has not married a man and had children at her age. I can understand people who think that the author didn't go far enough with the social commentary in this book, but I think the sheer hypocrisy of the incel character, and the ways he, another "social reject", differs from Furukura, was pretty good social commentary in itself.

        <summary><i>Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention</i> by Johann Hari</summary>
        <div class="review">
            Since reading this book and learning just how fragile human attention can be, I have definitely found myself being more careful with my sleep, diet, and exercise so that my brain is better equipped to focus well. So in that sense, I think this book has done what it needs to do. But I will admit that I found this author pretty irritating, particularly in the earlier chapters. In the book, he reports facts relevant to attention and focus from experts in a variety of different fields (such as neuroscientists, psychologists, and the designers and engineers of our electronic devices), and interleaves these facts with his experiences with quitting the Internet and modern electronics entirely for a few months. This personal touch would've been nice if he yammered a lot less about irrelevant details, such as how seeing that he missed almost no emails when he returned to the Internet bruised his ego or whatever. It's almost as if you shouldn't alienate your readers with unnecessary details when writing about a problem you are trying to frame as ubiquitous! That being said, it's not difficult to read through to get to the valuable details, it's more just a gripe I have that I wonder why more people don't talk about. Also, I only found out about this weeks after finishing the book, but his absolute dumpster fire of a Wikipedia page really makes me doubt his integrity as an author now. I probably would've once actively recommended this book to others, but I'm not sure that I will anymore.
