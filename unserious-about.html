<br>—A friend
<br><br>
"I couldn't even solve the crossword on my cereal box this morning."
<br>"Well, what makes you think I could?"
<br>"Idk, you'd probably program Djikstra's to do it for you or something."

<br><br>Digital privacy, feminist theory, Alan Turing's life story and seminal works, my best friend Val (as historians would put it), rainy weather, 2000s web games (I am not immune to nostalgia), the taste of alcohol, a long meandering walk after spending the day in a solo study room
<br><br>I will probably remove some of these things if I reference them on the site more later, but for now it's nice to have them in a list.

<br>Which site graphics were drawn in Scratch with a mouse?
<br><br>In case you were curious: The abacus on the front page, the objects on the about page, the logo and spinning disk animation on the artwork page, and the site buttons. (I think that's all of them?)
