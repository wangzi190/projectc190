        "Tyto albot" species
        "Should machines think?"










    Concept details:
    IN A NUTSHELL: HIGHLY TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED ALIEN OWL-HUMANOIDS FUCK UP THEIR
    PLANET BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF ETHICS. THEY BEGIN LOOKING FOR 
    RESOURCES AND GATHERING INTEL ON HUMANS ON EARTH.

    ILLUSTRATIONS SHOULD DETAIL PECULIAR EVENTS THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE ALIEN ACTIVITY

    OWLS ALREADY HAVE SUCH AN ALIEN-LIKE QUALITY.. WHAT IF THEY WERE REALLY ALIENS
    FROM ANOTHER WORLD? WHAT ARE THEIR PHILOSOPHIES, MORALS? WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THEM?

    Piece ideas (!!!!):
    Mediums : Crayon for texture (and bright or otherwise unconventional colors?) +sketch
    Add cutouts to make a scrap book ish look (Imitation game cutouts!!)

    Brainstorming stuff :
        Alien barn owl people send mechanical barn owls to drive out/compromise
        Earth's barn owls to gather intel on humans

        WHAT IF THE ALIENS ARE ALL BIRD PEOPLE AND THE BARN OWL ALIENS ARE THE ONES
        TASKED TO DESIGN BARN OWL MACHINES TO GATHER RESOURCES (BECAUSE
        THEIR PLANET IS RUNNING OUT OF THEM) AND INTEL ON HUMANS 

        AND BECAUSE OWLS ARE SUCH EFFICIENT HUNTERS THE ROBOT BARN OWLS END UP OUTHUNTING
        EARTH'S BARN OWLS AND DRIVING DOWN ITS POPULATION

        WHAT IF THE ALIEN BIRD PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ONLY WITH LITTLE TO NO 
        UNDERSTANDING OF DESIGN ETHICS ULTIMATELY CAUSING DESTRUCTION TO THE PLANETS
        THEY INHABIT

        NO WAIT THE ALIEN BIRD PEOPLE SHOULD JUST BE OWLS BECAUSE THEY ARE
        REGARDED AS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT BY MANY BUT ARE ONLY VERY EFFICIENT 
        AT THINGS LIKE HUNTING, ETC. AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH BRAINSPACE TO USE ON 
        OTHER COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. WHICH IS WHY THE ALIEN OWLS DONT KNOW SHIT ABOUT
        ETHICS AND END UP DESTROYING THE PLANETS THEY INHABIT THE MORE ADVANCED
        THEY BECOME

        Point: Show viewers something so wacky that it makes them uncomfortable with
        anything resembling it in modern day (i.e. barn owl people angry that
        humans don't like their more "efficient" machine barn owls; barn owl
        people insisting that it is better to replace barn owls with machines for
        the sake of efficiency/profit)
        (Insisting Earths barn owls are weak, useless)

            The barn owls have begun to show strange behaviors. We caught one to research the other day.
            On the lab security footage, it appears to have spun its head multiple times in the same direction.
            It is equally as active in the day as it is at night.

            The tyto albot is a bird species documented by Ornis Technology researchers
            in 1990. Though the species closely resembles the barn owl, it has shown behaviors
            anomalous enough to be classi

            It turns out that the sharp decrease in the barn owl population is
            due to a strange new bird species in the area. Though the species appears
            similar to the barn owl, it has shown behaviors anomalous enough to give
            scientist a reason to suspect it is something entirely different. 
            
            Dubbed the "tyto albot" by
            locals, it resembles the barn owl (tyto alba), but its behaviors are so
            (?? Idk rambling but these are things you could write on the piece i guess)

        Users of a certain mobile app report amnesic(?) symptoms even if not
        predisposed to amnesia

        "Resetting your brain" fearing you are no longer yourself; wanting to start again

        Barn owl aliens so dizzy with influences from human technology that they want to reset their minds?
        Human developer pirates the software the barn owl aliens use to reset their minds, and publishes
        it in their own name? Other humans who download and use the software get their minds reset?
