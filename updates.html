Updates
<br>[12.30.25] Revamped "<a href="/about.html">about</a>" and got a custom domain <img src="/images/emotes//nukoCelebrate1.gif" class="emote"> Also, the site is now hosted on a YunoHost instance with the help of my friend <a href="https://digitalorchid.net/" target="_blank">digitalorchid</a>.
<br><br>[11.15.25] Migrated to Teacake Hosting! If anything on the site has broken, please let me know.
<br>Edit: The site is no longer hosted on Teacake. I would still very much recommend it to other (hobbyist) webmasters, though! The admin is quick to respond and very helpful.
<br><br>[10.11.25] Revamped the <a href="/artwork.html">artworks page</a> and added a new drawing. Also made a couple changes <a href="/mahjong.html">here</a> and <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.
<br><br>[09.07.25] Uploaded a short MIPS Tetris <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/3blbia.mp4" target="_blank">demo video</a>.
<br><br>[09.06.25] New <a href="/projects/esolangs/playing-sic-1.html">article</a> about playing SIC-1 and programming in the OISC esolang Subleq.
<br><br>[08.24.25] New <a href="/projects/mips-tetris/stopping-blocks.html">article</a> about the latest MIPS Tetris developments. The program is now entirely functional and playable as a Tetris game! There's still a few more things I'm hoping to iron out at some point, though.
<br><br>[08.10.25] New book review <a href="/reading.html">here</a>, new pixel button <a href="/about.html">here</a>, finally wrote descriptions for my <a href="/artwork.html">artworks</a>, and decorative changes <a href="/mahjong.html">here</a> and <a href="/reading.html">here</a>. More underway in my drafts as usual.
<br><br>[07.25.25] Added a new book review and revised a few previous ones.
<br><br>[07.05.25] Did a layout change for some of the pages (and a few other adjustments), so clear your cache! Also, the "cache" page has been renamed to "miscellany", which I find more descriptive, but otherwise the site is still largely the same in terms of material.
<br>Edit: You can view an archived version of the previous layout <a href="/archive/v2.html">here</a>.
<br><br><span class="date">[06.27.25]</span> 3.7k words and 20 diagrams later, I've decided to finally release my most gargantuan article yet, "<a href="/projects/explainers/trees.html">Binary search trees, 2-3-4 trees, and red-black trees</a>". Also new on the <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> page is MIPS Tetris documentation post "<a href="/projects/mips-tetris/cleaning-and-optimizing.html">Cleaning and optimizing the program</a>" and a <a href="/projects/nand2tetris/closure.html">closure</a> post for Nand2Tetris.
<br><br><span class="date">[06.23.25]</span> Made an <a href="/extended-about.html">unserious about</a> page you can navigate to by clicking the cat doodle on the regular about page,
and added a bare-bones, <a href="/artwork-!js.html">JS-free version</a> of the artwork page.
(Mr. President, another form of procrastination has hit the expository article.)
<br><br><span class="date">[06.08.25]</span> Decided to push a bunch of smaller changes today so they don't overshadow my upcoming changes to the projects page.
I moved the reading page to the main navbar, made some changes to the <a href="/reading.html">reading</a>, <a href="/miscellany.html">cache</a>, and <a href="/outlinks.html">outlinks</a> pages, and added a new page, "<a href="/mahjong.html">Mahjong Progress Log</a>", to the cache page.
<br><br><span class="date">[05.11.25]</span> Since uploading my site overhaul in February, I've written a bunch of journal entries and added a "<a href="/miscellany.html">cache</a>" page to link a bunch of miscellaneous pages on.
Today, I added a couple new pages, "<a href="/reading.html">Reading</a>" and "<a href="/miscellany/how-i-study.html">How I Study as an Academic Weapon</a>", to the cache page, and uploaded a bunch of new graphics to the <a href="/miscellany/graphics-hoard.html">graphics hoard</a>. I've got more cooking up in my drafts right now, so please look forward to it!
<br><br><span class="date">[02.21.25]</span> The new site overhaul is finally live! I decided to go for a clean, focused look, where I am free to write as much as I like without having to worry about annoying textcutoffs or whatnot. I hope that lessening the emphasis on the design of the site by making it more of a container for my work than anything else will enable me to focus more on activities that matter to me.
You can view an archived version of the old index page <a href="/archive/v1.html" style="color: #779608;text-decoration:underline;">here</a>, just note that most of the links have been removed.
