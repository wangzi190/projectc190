"I'm happy to report that this [website] ... will never be finished. It is a living document that grows and matures, just like most of real life. It is not a 'work in progress', for this would imply not much intrinsic value until that magic day it is completed."

Updates
<br>[07.16.25] Added some more mahjong ramblings and yet again made a bunch of inconsequential tweaks throughout the site. <img src="/images/emotes/nukoFatigue.gif" class="emote">
<br><br>[07.05.25] I'm sorry for doing the ultimate web design sin and accidentally setting the font to Courier New when I intended it to be DejaVu Sans Mono. (It was showing up right locally!) <img src="/images/emotes/nukoEmbarrassed5.gif" class="emote"> It has since been fixed.
<br><br>[07.05.25] Did a layout change for some of the pages (and a few other adjustments), so clear your cache! Also, the "cache" page has been renamed to "miscellany", which I find more descriptive, but otherwise the site is still largely the same in terms of material.
<br>Edit: You can view an archived version of the previous layout <a href="/archive/v2.html">here</a>.
<br><br><span class="date">[06.27.25]</span> 3.7k words and 20 diagrams later, I've decided to finally release my most gargantuan article yet, "<a href="/projects/explainers/trees.html">Binary search trees, 2-3-4 trees, and red-black trees</a>". Also new on the <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> page is MIPS Tetris documentation post "<a href="/projects/mips-tetris/cleaning-and-optimizing.html">Cleaning and optimizing the program</a>" and a <a href="/projects/nand2tetris/closure.html">closure</a> post for Nand2Tetris.
<br><br><span class="date">[06.25.25]</span> Reworked the information on my <a href="/mahjong.html">mahjong log</a> page.
<br><br><span class="date">[06.23.25]</span> Made an <a href="/unserious-about.html">unserious about</a> page you can navigate to by clicking the cat doodle on the regular about page,
and added a bare-bones, <a href="/artwork-!js.html">JS-free version</a> of the artwork page.
(Mr. President, another form of procrastination has hit the expository article.)
<br><br><span class="date">[06.08.25]</span> Decided to push a bunch of smaller changes today so they don't overshadow my upcoming changes to the projects page.
I moved the reading page to the main navbar, made some changes to the <a href="/reading">reading</a>, <a href="/miscellany.html">cache</a>, and <a href="/outlinks.html">outlinks</a> pages, and added a new page, "<a href="/mahjong.html">Mahjong Progress Log</a>", to the cache page.
<br><br><span class="date">[05.11.25]</span> Since uploading my site overhaul in February, I've written a bunch of journal entries and added a "<a href="/miscellany.html">cache</a>" page to link a bunch of miscellaneous pages on.
Today, I added a couple new pages, "<a href="/reading">Reading</a>" and "<a href="/miscellany/how-i-study.html">How I Study as an Academic Weapon</a>", to the cache page, and uploaded a bunch of new graphics to the <a href="/miscellany/graphics-hoard.html">graphics hoard</a>. I've got more cooking up in my drafts right now, so please look forward to it!
<br><br><span class="date">[02.21.25]</span> The new site overhaul is finally live! I decided to go for a clean, focused look, where I am free to write as much as I like without having to worry about annoying textcutoffs or whatnot. I hope that lessening the emphasis on the design of the site by making it more of a container for my work than anything else will enable me to focus more on activities that matter to me.
You can view an archived version of the old index page <a href="/archive/v1.html" style="color: #779608;text-decoration:underline;">here</a>, just note that most of the links have been removed.
