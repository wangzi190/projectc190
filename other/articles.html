Articles I like :)<br><br>
<a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2002/07/01/cultural-diversity-policy-a-formula-for-indifference" target="_blank"><u>C</u>ultural diversity policy</a>: A formula for indifference?
<div style="color:#7b8a48;"><b>Preview:</b> <i>The UK Federation of Chinese Schools will perform at the Victoria and Albert Museumâ€™s next conference "Connections and disconnections". Delegates will be able to bask in the warm glow of respecting something else and the federation will go home with the confirmation that they are different first and artists second. Their art will not be set free nor truly understood and neither will they.</i></div>
<br><a href="https://sadgrl.online/cyberspace/internet-manifesto.html" target="_blank"><u>I</u>nternet Manifesto</a>
<div style="color:#7b8a48;"><b>Preview:</b> <i>It's surprising how many people equate "the Internet" with "social media". It's like having access to 1,000,000x the Library of Alexandria every day, and only being interested in keeping up with what people are talking about in the lobby.</i></div>
