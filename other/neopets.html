        <td><br>(This page is a WIP <i>!!</i>) I first played Neopets in 2013. Admittedly, 8-year-old me didn't fully understand how the game worked. But that didn't stop me from enjoying its world and characters, and creating characters of my own, too. I have since returned to Neopets, and still find it fun. I hope it can inspire creativity in me the same way it did when I was little. Click the blue Aisha sitting on this text, and he will lead you to my account.</td>
