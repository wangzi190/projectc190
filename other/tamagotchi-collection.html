<br>Here they are! Pictured (left to right) is the Tamagotchi ON Wonder Garden, the Original Tamagotchi, and the Tamagotchi mini.
<br><br>I took this photo the day I snagged the Mametchi comic book pattern Tamagotchi from a local comic books store, which is why that little tab in it when you unbox it is still there. I also have two other Tamagotchi minis that I didn't include in this photo. So, I've got 5 total :')
