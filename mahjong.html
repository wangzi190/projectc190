    <b>My Mahjong Page</b> 🀄
    <br>
    This is my page for mahjong, particularly ranked online riichi mahjong.
    <br>
    I like riichi mahjong for its strategic depth, emphasis on defensive play, and elements of chance.
    In some strange way, it's kind of nice that you can make perfect plays but still lose.
    Playing mahjong helps me keep a calm and clear mind regardless of what chance events occur.
    I'm better able to perceive the big picture and analyze carefully rather than becoming disoriented over mishaps out of my control, a skill that has fairly obvious applications in everyday life too.
    I really enjoy this game and I'd readily recommend it to others. (Tip: Once you learn the base game, read <a href="https://dainachiba.github.io/RiichiBooks" target="_blank">RB1</a>!)

    <u>My stats and playstyle</u>
    <br>I'm ranked Expert 2 in Mahjong Soul and my stats look something like this.
    <br>(I have been farming Silver Room for some time, so they are probably kind of inflated. I'd like to think I'm good at the game, but honestly who knows.
    Though, what I can say is that I definitely have a distinct advantage over someone who "just knows the rules".)
    <br><img src="/images/jong/stats_1.png" class="pic fullsize">
    <br><img src="/images/jong/stats_2.png" class="pic fullsize">
    <br>As for my playstyle, I'm a fairly by-the-books low-risk player, though I don't mind making "unconventional" moves based on what I've perceived about the people I'm playing with.
    I generally prefer to keep closed hands, aiming for value via yaku such as riichi and pinfu.
    <br><br><u>Fun information for fun people</u>
    <br>Favorite yaku: Pinfu (The only correct favorite.)
    <br>Least favorite yaku: Seven pairs (It's so irritating to play...)

    It's been a while so I thought I'd make a quick update.
    I've gotten into the unfortunate habit of playing sanma to complete MJS in-game events, and not really focusing on strategy... That said, I have played some Silver Room South to get used to the game format, so I don't fumble in Gold lmao.
    It's kind of silly but forgetting that I'm in South round has completely messed up the results of a game for me (e.g. not pon'ing South and fumbling a hand with multiple dora). Hopefully I don't make that mistake again.
    <br><br>
    I am not entirely sure if I want to play another tournament, but I might for the sake of not ending on a bad note. I did last semester and got a pretty solid start, but then received a class notification that totally stressed me out, and suffice to say my score really suffered.
    I have started showing to meets again, but all the most experienced players play competitive, so I'm not sure how much I'm learning by continuing to play casual.
    Anyway, I'll probably update on this if I sign up, but so far I haven't heard of competitive events that interest me.
    <br><br>
    Somewhat off topic now, but I always considered chess to be notoriously male-dominated, and didn't think mahjong was that bad, relatively speaking (Can you tell I'm a computer science major?). 
    Yet, the first meetup I went to in a while was all men except for me. All of the regulars are pretty friendly so it honestly still wasn't bad, but it was just jarring.

    I've been playing mahjong IRL at a local weekly meet for several weeks now, so I thought I'd talk a bit about that.
    You'd think it's not much different from playing online, but really there's a number of things you need to adapt to.
    The obvious is that you can no longer mouse over a tile to highlight all the copies of it on the table, but weirdly enough
    you might also struggle to remember to draw a tile before discarding one.
    Online clients like MahjongSoul don't actually train the habit of drawing a tile; your draw just automatically materializes when it's your turn, and all you have to do is click to discard.
    It's a little pathetic, but at the first couple of meets I'd sometimes accidentally end up with one less tile than I should have.
    I did learn a neat trick to quickly discern whether you have the right number of tiles, though: Take 3 tiles from the left and right sides of your hand, and stack them on top of the remaining leftmost and rightmost 3 tiles.
    If there's 1 tile in between, you've got the correct number of tiles (13, because a complete hand is 14).
    Also, turns out it's good etiquette to keep the tile you just drew separate from your hand until you choose a tile to discard (so hand-reading is less crazy for the other players), which I definitely need to make a better habit of doing.
    <br><br>
    Adapting to IRL play aside, I honestly didn't expect to be a solidly above average player at the meet.
    Maybe looking at mahjong YouTube and Reddit where everyone is totally cracked has warped what I think makes a "good" player.
    It kind of makes me feel bad that I come in every week to own and pwn generally at least one poor new player, but that's about what playing MJS Silver Room is like nowadays anyway...
    <br>
    This is barely related to the theme of this entry, but I recently made the grave mistake of playing my first Gold Room South game while really tired and lost pretty badly.
    So, if you are reading this, this is your sign not to play ranked while you're tired lmao.

    I can feel myself slipping into another mahjong hiatus, so I figure I should pick up some new strategy principles before I check out of it completely. (It's so they sit in my mind for a while; it helps okay?)
    I decided to brush up on kabe and read about matagi suji and sotogawa.
    To my understanding, kabe is like an extension of basic suji theory in the sense that it assumes your opponent has a ready hand with a 2-sided wait.
    However, instead of being about a partcular opponent's discards, it's about which tiles are completely visible to you (i.e., you can see all 4 of that tile).
    For example, if 3m is completely visible (and you assume your opponent has a 2-sided wait), they cannot have a 23m or 34m wait, which makes 12m safer.
    Though it's tempting to conclude that 45m must also be safe, your opponent could still have a 56m or 67m wait, so a visible 3m doesn't necessarily indicate that.
    Kabe is a fairly natural extension of basic suji; I just need to practice reasoning through it so it comes to me faster during the heat of a game.
    <br><br>
    As for matagi suji and sotogawa, the two feel niche and almost contradictory to basic suji theory. Though I can understand the ideas, I'm not entirely sure when they apply.
    In the vague, matagi suji hinges on the idea that opponents are likely to keep strong shapes such as 556, 445, etc., throwing the duplicate 5 or 4 later in the game as they move toward a 2-sided wait (statistically the most likely).
    So, it makes sense that later discards should be evaluated using this reasoning, but I guess I'm still hesistant to trust it when I've been clinging to basic suji for so long.
    Meanwhile, I know sotogawa should be applied to earlier discards, but I have a similar hesitancy to trust it. (I probably just have to get used to it though.)
    To elaborate on sotogawa, the underlying idea is that tiles thrown earlier in the game are typically either floating or redundant, meaning tiles "outward" of early discards (e.g., 12m if 3m is an early discard) are safer.
    It does make sense, but I have to admit it's more nuance than I'm used to considering in Silver Room.
    I hope these strategy principles become more intuitive to me with time. I will probably write through the reasoning behind strategies more as I grapple with them.
    <br><br>
    Off-topic for this entry, but I tried playing on Riichi City a few weeks ago. (Yes, I was that nervous about ranking back down to Adept in Majsoul.)
    It's nice that it has a Linux Steam client and various ways to practice things like hand value estimation, but the lewding of the characters is pretty egregious, and I've also heard the ranking system is scuffed.
    I might play Riichi City again if it adds classical Chinese or Sichuan mahjong, but otherwise it's a hard no from me lmao.
    Waifus? Husbandos? I just wanna play mahjong for God's sake...

    <br>I haven't really been writing on here because I've been on an immense game grind. And it finally paid off!
    <br><img src="/images/jong/expert_I.png" width="500px" class="pic">
    <br>I know I'm going to get screwed over in Gold Room if I don't really step it up, so I'm going to take a break from playing, at least on Majsoul 4p.
    <hr>
    [06.22.25]
    <br>Something funny I've noticed in Silver Room is that when players call a sequence or triplet that contains terminals, they often hold 2 dragons or round or seat wind tiles they intend to form a triplet with later. (Is this what people mean when they talk about analogue strategy?). If this is the competition we are so making it to Expert.
    <hr>
    [06.05.25]
    <br>From playing and reviewing logs a little today I think I'm probably too hesitant to full fold when I'm 2nd or 3rd place.
    I should probably read up on defense and deliberately train it instead of getting too caught up in tile efficiency and maintaining tenpai when I have something to lose.
    <br><br>Unrelated, but I'm also pissed because I had a solid +70 on my rank points, but lost it because I queued up for another game and it simply refused to connect. Then I quickly got temp banned for "AFK activity", which made joining the game impossible even if I tried...

    <br><img src="/images/jong/adept_III.png" class="pic fullsize">
    <br>Sat down to play a few games today and ranked up to Adept III! I've been on the verge of ranking up for some time now so I'm super happy that I finally did.
    I'll look at my logs later I guess lol.
    <hr>
    [06.01.25]
    <br><img src="/images/jong/maka_1.png" class="pic fullsize">
    <br>For some reason, I keep getting donked by Maka over tossing dragons instead of other floating tiles.
    <br>I think 9m is the recommended discard here because though both it and green dragon are quite difficult to pair up, pairing up green dragon gives my hand a yaku and more value, whereas 9m would do neither.
    However, as the round goes on, I should definitely get rid of any floating dragon tiles for efficiency and potentially as a defensive maneuver.
    I guess 1s is also a reasonable discard option at the moment, but not especially recommended to help the possibility of a pure straight? 
    <hr>
    [05.15.25]
    <br><img src="/images/jong/maka_2.jpg" class="pic fullsize">
    <br>I wasn't sure why kan is apparently the move here, because I usually decide against it unless I'm sorely losing.
    It looks like because the player across from me has 2 open calls, they are likely to be in tenpai, and their last block is likely to be incomplete because I hold 6 58s, making 8s a dangerous tile.
    I can see the rationale, but I think I just didn't kan because I didn't want the player across from me to potentially gain hand value.
    I also sometimes forget that after a kan, I draw again from the dead wall, so kan'ing won't mess up my hand as much as I think it does, especially not in this situation.
