    <b>My Mahjong Page</b> ðŸ€„
    <br>
    This is my page for mahjong, particularly ranked online riichi mahjong.
    I like riichi mahjong for its complexity and emphasis on defensive strategy, and its active online community is also a big plus.
    <br>
    At some point, I am hoping to release an article about why you should play riichi mahjong and how to get started if you're new.
    But for now, this page is mostly my self-indulgent ramblings about the game.

    <u>My player stats</u>
    <br>I'm ranked Expert I in Mahjong Soul and my stats look something like this.
    So, there's lots of room for improvement.
    <br><img src="/images/jong/stats_1.png" width="590px">
    <br><img src="/images/jong/stats_2.png" width="590px">
    <br>(I suspect that my 4th rate and deal-in rate are lower than the Detailed Info section states, considering that the Ranking Statistics section, which is based on my last 100 matches, looks a lot better.
    Though, I guess there's no way to know my "true" stats until I play much more. The important thing is to keep practicing, of course.)
    <br><br><u>How I engage with mahjong</u>
    <br>I usually play mahjong in short bursts and then ignore it for up to months. You'd think that wouldn't be great if my goal is to improve, but I've actually found it somewhat helpful because when I return to the game it's with fresh eyes.
    Breaks also prevent me from becoming overly obsessed with the stats, and allow me to better focus on the game when I do play.
    <br>I also like to watch Mahjong Soul official tournaments, which they post on their YouTube channel.
    <br><br><u>Fun information for fun people</u>
    <br>Favorite yaku: Mixed triple sequence
    <br>Least favorite yaku: Seven pairs
    <br>Other things I like building to in-game, when within reason: Dual pon wait (even better if on honors or terminals), suji trap wait
    <br>Majsoul PID: 117518950 (Add me!)
    <br>Majsoul mains: Sawako, Ichihime

    Below is where I talk more about mahjong specifics, such as how games have been going, what strategy principles I'm learning, and more.

    <br>
    I can feel myself slipping into another mahjong hiatus, so I figure I should pick up some new strategy principles before I check out of it completely. (It's so they sit in my mind for a while; it helps okay?)
    I decided to brush up on kabe and read about matagi suji and sotogawa.
    To my understanding, kabe is like an extension of basic suji theory in the sense that it assumes your opponent has a ready hand with a 2-sided wait.
    However, instead of being about a partcular opponent's discards, it's about which tiles are completely visible to you (i.e., you can see all 4 of that tile).
    For example, if 3m is completely visible (and you assume your opponent has a 2-sided wait), they cannot have a 23m or 34m wait, which makes 12m safer.
    Though it's tempting to conclude that 45m must also be safe, your opponent could still have a 56m or 67m wait, so a visible 3m doesn't necessarily indicate that.
    Kabe is a fairly natural extension of basic suji; I just need to practice reasoning through it so it comes to me faster during the heat of a game.
    <br><br>
    As for matagi suji and sotogawa, the two feel niche and almost contradictory to basic suji theory. Though I can understand the ideas, I'm not entirely sure when they apply.
    In the vague, matagi suji hinges on the idea that opponents are likely to keep strong shapes such as 556, 445, etc., throwing the duplicate 5 or 4 later in the game as they move toward a 2-sided wait (statistically the most likely).
    So, it makes sense that later discards should be evaluated using this reasoning, but I guess I'm still hesistant to trust it when I've been clinging to basic suji for so long.
    Meanwhile, I know sotogawa should be applied to earlier discards, but I have a similar hesitancy to trust it. (I probably just have to get used to it though.)
    To elaborate on sotogawa, the underlying idea is that tiles thrown earlier in the game are typically either floating or redundant, meaning tiles "outward" of early discards (e.g., 12m if 3m is an early discard) are safer.
    It does make sense, but I have to admit it's more nuance than I'm used to considering in Silver Room.
    I hope these strategy principles become more intuitive to me with time. I will probably write through the reasoning behind strategies more as I grapple with them.

    Off-topic for this entry, but I tried playing on Riichi City a few weeks ago. (Yes, I was that nervous about ranking back down to Adept in Majsoul.)
    It's nice that it has a Linux Steam client and various ways to practice things like hand value estimation, but good lord the lewding of the characters is <i>insane</i>. I've also heard the ranking system is scuffed in that it encourages aggressive play uncharacteristic of riichi; yikes.
    I might play Riichi City again if it adds classical Chinese or Sichuan mahjong, but otherwise it's a hard no from me lmao.
    Waifus? Husbandos? I just wanna play mahjong for God's sake...

    <br>I haven't really been writing on here because I've been on an immense game grind. And it finally paid off!
    <br><img src="/images/jong/expert_I.png" width="500px">
    <br>I know I'm going to get screwed over in Gold Room if I don't really step it up, so I'm going to take a break from playing, at least on Majsoul 4p.

    <br>Something funny I've noticed in Silver Room is that when players call a sequence or triplet that contains terminals, they often hold 2 dragons or round or seat wind tiles they intend to form a triplet with later. (Is this what people mean when they talk about analogue strategy?). If this is the competition we are so making it to Expert.

    <br>From playing and reviewing logs a little today I think I'm probably too hesitant to full fold when I'm 2nd or 3rd place.
    I should probably read up on defense and deliberately train it instead of getting too caught up in tile efficiency and maintaining tenpai when I have something to lose.
    <br><br>Unrelated, but I'm also pissed because I had a solid +70 on my rank points, but lost it because I queued up for another game and it simply refused to connect. Then I quickly got temp banned for "AFK activity", which made joining the game impossible even if I tried...

    <br>Sat down to play a few games today and ranked up to Adept III! I've been on the verge of ranking up for some time now so I'm super happy that I finally did.
    I'll look at my logs later I guess lol.

    <br><img src="/images/jong/maka_1.png" width="590px">
    <br>For some reason, I keep getting donked by Maka over tossing dragons instead of other floating tiles.
    <br>I think 9m is the recommended discard here because though both it and green dragon are quite difficult to pair up, pairing up green dragon gives my hand a yaku and more value, whereas 9m would do neither.
    However, as the round goes on, I should definitely get rid of any floating dragon tiles for efficiency and potentially as a defensive maneuver.
    I guess 1s is also a reasonable discard option at the moment, but not especially recommended to help the possibility of a pure straight?

    <br><img src="/images/jong/maka_2.jpg" width="590px">
    <br>I wasn't sure why kan is apparently the move here, because I usually decide against it unless I'm sorely losing.
    It looks like because the player across from me has 2 open calls, they are likely to be in tenpai, and their last block is likely to be incomplete because I hold 6 58s, making 8s a dangerous tile.
    I can see the rationale, but I think I just didn't kan because I didn't want the player across from me to potentially gain hand value.
    I also sometimes forget that after a kan, I draw again from the dead wall, so kan'ing won't mess up my hand as much as I think it does, especially not in this situation.
