[02.17.25] My 20th birthday
<br>
I know the previous iteration of my website featured generally longer posts in a list of URLs, but to be honest, I don't think my life is interesting enough for me to sustainably keep that up. So, I'm going to try a feed sort of thing to take off the pressure to write a certain amount. I think I like my journal page more this way anyway.
<br>
I celebrated my 20th birthday yesterday with my friends from school. It was probably the most excited I'd felt for my birthday since I was a child (Which is seriously saying something, because I probably stopped feeling holiday spirit past the age of 15).
<br>
We played riichi mahjong using the mini mahjong set I bought at a Chinese New Year festival a few weeks back, and went out to a nearby restaurant to have some of my favorite foods. I was so relieved that my friends were willing to learn mahjong despite its somewhat convoluted rules (Shoutout to the friend who spent the entire morning learning the game; you are utterly insane). It definitely has a learning curve, but it's very fun once you get the hang of it. We also had plenty of time to just chat and relax, and it was just a blast in every way. I've been feeling pretty drained from school lately so it was a very welcome break.
<br>
My birthday last year was really different. For the most part, I was near crashing out after exams and essay assignments and whatnot. I'd just barely mustered the energy to go to math club in the evening, and that was pretty much the highlight of the day. I think that day we were discussing real analysis or something? I don't remember too well. I just wanted to get shit done and then sleep.
<br>
It's crazy how much can change in a year. I never could've imagined I'd meet such friendly and understanding people who I feel are similar enough to me that we click well, but can also offer me a lot of new perspectives.
<br>
I don't think I would've thought to plan something nice for my birthday at all if I hadn't gotten it into my thick skull that I should care about having fun. When I accepted my offer to the school I'm at now, I didn't care for anything about it other than the fact that it has a decent CS program. I didn't think I needed friends or anything like that (I remember reading a forum thread about graduating with no friends, and thinking that would be me...), and I expected to spend my time here alone studying. I do spend a decent chunk of my time that way, to be fair, but it's a lot nicer having friends to remind me that there's more to life than that. Human connection is pretty cool or something.
