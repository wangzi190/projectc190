    [02.28.25] Utterly losing it
    <br>
    Could I just be writing more on here lately because I uploaded my site overhaul recently, or because actually interesting things are happening? Both, to be honest.
<br>It might have been a little irresponsible of me to apply to only one very prestegious and highly selective summer program. To be fair, it was the only program I'd heard about and almost immediately decided I needed to apply to, though. I want to travel abroad for research so badly!!
<br>Anyways, I recently received an e-mail that I got waitlisted from the program, which was actually a pleasant surprise because I kind of felt like I was just applying to get outright rejected <img src="/images/emotes/nukoForcedLaugh.gif" class="emote"> From this I figured there's a higher-ranked applicant who received the offer, and if they decline it, I might be pulled up from the listâ€”because that's usually how it works, isn't it?
<br>I e-mailed the PhD students on both of the research projects I applied to for more information, and one of them responded to me astonishingly fast, especially considering the timezone difference. They stated that they were currently unsure about funding, that no one had gotten or accepted an offer for the project... and moreover, that I was ranked "very high ðŸ˜‰". Yes, with the <i>winky face emote</i>. Like, forreal?? I feel like I am going insane right now. Am I delusional for thinking I could've been ranked first, but got deferred for now because of uncertain funding?? I've been tossing and turning in my sleep because of this. How am I just supposed to wake up every day and do everything like normal, knowing that my results are very likely to come out any time between right now and next week <img src="/images/emotes/nukoAgitated.gif" class="emote">
<br>I am trying not to get too hopeful as not to set myself up for a more upsetting rejection :'( Because the reality is that I still don't know what is going to happen. And the fact that I'm even being highly considered for a program like this definitely means there are more great opportunities waiting for me, even if I'm rejected this time, right? In the meantime, the anticipation is seriously killing me <img src="/images/emotes/nukoEmbarrassed5.gif" class="emote"> I'd like to think I've waited all this time to <i>not</i> get rejected, but who knows... I'll really try to stomach it as a rejection right now so I'm not let down later <img src="/images/emotes/nukoCrySitting.gif" class="emote">

    <br>I have to be experiencing academic sunk cost fallacy or something. I don't get what's wrong with me.
    <br>--
    <br>Thoughts on <i>Into the Wild</i>:
    <br>It's not that I don't like the book, it just makes me upset. Is it jealousy? I don't know.
    <br>--
    <br>Sometimes I wish my commute was long enough that I could comfortably read on the bus.
    <br>--
    <br>My 10-year-old Thinkpad lags or freezes when I have 15+ tabs open and has barely 1/4th the space of recent computers. Somehow I feel like that's better for me.
    <br>--
    <br>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfBso0Y4ETI&list=LL" target="_blank">this YouTube video</a> recently.

[02.17.25] My 20th birthday
<br>
I know the previous iteration of my website featured generally longer posts in a list of URLs, but to be honest, I don't think my life is interesting enough for me to sustainably keep that up. So, I'm going to try a feed sort of thing to take off the pressure to write a certain amount. I think I like my journal page more this way anyway.
<br>
I celebrated my 20th birthday yesterday with my friends from school. It was probably the most excited I'd felt for my birthday since I was a child (Which is seriously saying something, because I probably stopped feeling holiday spirit past the age of 15).
<br>
We played riichi mahjong using the mini mahjong set I bought at a Chinese New Year festival a few weeks back, and went out to a nearby restaurant to have some of my favorite foods. I was so relieved that my friends were willing to learn mahjong despite its somewhat convoluted rules (Shoutout to the friend who spent the entire morning learning the game; you are utterly insane). It definitely has a learning curve, but it's very fun once you get the hang of it. We also had plenty of time to just chat and relax, and it was just a blast in every way. I've been feeling pretty drained from school lately so it was a very welcome break.
<br>
My birthday last year was really different. For the most part, I was near crashing out after exams and essay assignments and whatnot. I'd just barely mustered the energy to go to math club in the evening, and that was pretty much the highlight of the day. I think that day we were discussing real analysis or something? I don't remember too well. I just wanted to get shit done and then sleep.
<br>
It's crazy how much can change in a year. I never could've imagined I'd meet such friendly and understanding people who I feel are similar enough to me that we click well, but can also offer me a lot of new perspectives.
<br>
I don't think I would've thought to plan something nice for my birthday at all if I hadn't gotten it into my thick skull that I should care about having fun. When I accepted my offer to the school I'm at now, I didn't care for anything about it other than the fact that it has a decent CS program. I didn't think I needed friends or anything like that (I remember reading a forum thread about graduating with no friends, and thinking that would be me...), and I expected to spend my time here alone studying. I do spend a decent chunk of my time that way, to be fair, but it's a lot nicer having friends to remind me that there's more to life than that. Human connection is pretty cool or something.
