    What goes up must come down
    <br>11.13.24
    <br><br>
    I might've overdone it the other week.
    <br><br>
    I had a big coding project, 2 more midterms, and a couple homework assignments. Though my to-do list wasn't exactly teeming with tasks, the handful of things I needed to do were worth pretty significant portions of my grade. I also hadn't done as well as I would've liked on the first exam for one of my classes, so I was determined to make up for it this time.
    <br><br>
    I got up at around 5am each day, put on metal music, chugged an energy drink, and got to work immediately, only diverting my focus to haphazardly shovel chips into my mouth as a lousy excuse for a meal. And the thing is, I worked incredibly well for long hours. I was so intensely concentrated that I felt that it'd cost much more of my effort to break focus than it would to keep going. And on top of that, I was having fun too. There was no bug I couldn't fix, no math problem I couldn't solve. Everything I'd previously been unclear on in class became intuitive after the time and effort I'd spent carefully reasoning my way through it, and it felt great.
    <br><br>
    In fact, it felt so great that I couldn't even anticipate the oncoming crash I was going to experience. I envisioned myself dedicating most of my weekend to working on the vision paper I'd met with my professor earlier in the week to discuss. It feels ridiculous to admit now, but I genuinely thought I could draft the entirety of my part before Monday.
    <br><br>
    When the weekend came, I didn't exactly feel bad, just not willing to do anything. I thought it'd pass in a few days time, but it didn't. For the next two weeks or so, I felt very hazy, and needed much more time to rest than usual. I fell asleep in my evening lecture yesterday despite having slept 7-8 hours. I found myself frequently spending time mindlessly listening to music, browsing the Web, or straight up staring at the wall and zoning out. Hours would pass, but when I looked back, I wouldn't be able to recall what I did. Though I could still get around to all my homework and classes in spite of this, I felt deeply disappointed that I couldn't even spend my free time doing things I enjoyed consciously and deliberately.
    <br><br>
    I guess dubbing this a "productivity hangover" is a little misleading. I'm not referring to the godawful corpo idea of "productivity"; I'm a student, why would I care? It's more a period of time where I struggle to even muster the energy to do things like read a book or watch TV. I can still tend to my barest obligations, which as of now is schoolwork in my two favorite topics, CS and math, so it's nothing I can't manage. I just wonder why it's so hard for me to adopt a more moderate approach to taking on all this.
    <br><br>
    To reframe this more positively, I feel grateful that in college, I can still get the top grades with this eccentric "work cycle" of mine. I'm never punished for getting struck with motivation to work ahead nor am I punished for having off days (or even off weeks), and I feel that I'm better able to take things at my own pace, whatever that pace may be.
    <br><br>
    But I don't know, it's weird, really. I probably appear incredibly well put-together and functional to others, but I don't feel that way internally at all. Maybe it's just that I'm too acclimated to myself to reasonably gauge how knowledgeable I am or how good I am at something, but even then, acknowledging that doesn't assure me much. I feel like my strengths only make up for my immense incompetence in things nobody else seems to struggle with. <i>Yeah, I'm barely functional as a human being sometimes, but surely my knack for computers absolves me of this?</i>

    School, research, exhaustion, and Halloween
    <br>10.26.24
    <br><br>
    Hey, it's been a while.
    <br><br>
    You'll probably recall that from January to June of this year I made myself write a monthly post about my life. In the time that I've stopped, I guess I couldn't really see the point of it anymore. I feel like I'm now able to casually write for this blog instead of sounding strangely stilted (Maybe it's just in my head, but I feel like my writing style is still trying to escape the grip of shitty English classes), so I don't think I need to hold myself to the monthly post thing anymore. Though it wasn't exactly my original intention, writing monthly helped me a lot with writing for my site in general, and I feel like I sound more like myself now.
    <br><br>
    I will probably just write whatever, whenever I feel like it now instead of continuing to write monthly. I've also since gotten busier, so I'm not sure it's viable anymore, anyway.
    <br><br>
    In any case, school has since started and it's going pretty well. I think I've become much more self-assured and able to self-regulate since last year. I was much more of a disaster than I let onto before, sure I got good grades but I don't think that's worth <i>constant</i> anxiety over every Canvas notification or whatnot. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a little too nonchalant now, but I figure I shouldn't overthink it if I'm still definitely doing well.
    <br><br>
    I guess I've never let onto this either, but I was never a good student until college, so being able to manage school in any capacity was unthinkable to me just a few years ago. To be honest, I feel like I'd probably be dropping out if I'd chosen to study anything other than computer science, but I digress.
    <br><br>
    Things are going so well lately that I'm terrified to jinx it. It just so happened that a new professor is teaching one of my classes, and that he's looking for undergraduates to work on research with. All I did was ask him what I could do, and over the last few weeks or so we've been coordinating a really cool project together. I will likely not go into too much detail here, but basically, it's a security and cryptography-related project that involves a bunch of CS and math things I've been wanting to get into, and I'm very excited about it.
    <br><br>
    In a way, I'm also relieved because I've been feeling like I'm hitting a wall in regards to how much I'm learning from school. A lot of what I'm covering in my classes right now (at least, in my CS classes) are things I already had some foundation of in high school because I don't know, I was nuts I guess. But as much as I enjoy scouring the Internet and reading PDFs and the like, I think I've been wishing for something bigger, and that this is that thing. Maybe that's a little dramatic, but in any case, I really hope this research goes somewhere.
    <br><br>
    Aside from all this, I wouldn't say there is much else going on in my life, not on a day-to-day basis anyway. I study, do my homework, read research papers, listen to gritty music on the late bus, rinse and repeat. It's pretty much the same most days, but I still enjoy it. I've also been making more friends (Hi, if you're reading this), which is a pleasant change from last school year when I practically spent months in isolation.
    <br><br>
    With that said, I'm still kind of getting a grip on my new workload, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't difficult sometimes. I've found that I can't have too many consecutive productive days without getting something I've dubbed a "productivity hangover". I'll just spend an entire day mindlessly seeking dopamine hits from stuff like shitty mobile games with relentless pop-ups prompting you to crack open your wallet. I am trying to funnel my downtime into things that I find more interesting and enriching, but I can't say I've been very successful at that so far.
    <br><br>
    I have made significant progress on my MIPS Tetris project, though! It was a real blast to work on, but I somewhat drag my feet when it comes to writing about it, even if I know it's for the best that I document my work. The next blog update on that will come out eventually.
    <br><br>
    Ah, I was also going to mention something about Halloween, because it's coming up and I'm not sure I'll be able to update again before then (Maybe it was a little misleading to put it in the title...). I used to be really into Halloween, but now I just don't have the energy. For some reason, every professor thinks we need high-pressure projects and exams to do leading up to October 31st specifically. Spoooky, huh? I don't think I'm going to get around to it, but for the record, I'd like to dress up as Patrick Bateman and have fake blood splattered down the side of my face. Maybe I'll show up to class like that on some random other day.
    <br><br>
    This is probably my most honest journal post to date. Anyways, until next time.
    <hr>
    I wrote a monthly journal entry about my life from January 2024 to June 2024, then decided I felt better about writing whenever I liked.
    <br><br>Below are those entries agglomerated into one post, in order of when they were written.
    I feel like I sound kind of dull and strangely stilted in many of these so please keep that in mind while reading<img src="/images/emotes/nukoEmbarrassed5.gif" class="emote">

    January 2024
    <br>01.31.2024
    <br><br>
    I don't particularly enjoy just <i>floating through life</i>, relegated to spending time on meaningless things by exhaustion, and unwilling to acknowledge the passing of time because I feel as though I'm wasting it. So of course, the sensible thing to do is to start journaling, I guess. As in, maybe making myself reflect on what I've been doing every so often will compel me to spend my time more mindfully.
    <br><br>
    I figure I'd go at it by making a monthly post chronicling memorable events, and generally stating my thoughts.
    <br><br>
    So anyways, I feel pretty good about the past month. On January 5th, I went to an arts festival in a neighboring city with some friends from school. There was live music, art galleries, lots of vendors, and even a shibari artist rigging volunteers, which I'd never seen in real life before. I ended up purchasing some cool rings, which I'd been meaning to do for a while.
    <br><br>
    On January 8th, the new semester started. I'd elected to take a proofs-focused upper division discrete math class instead of discrete math for CS majors (Basically, I chose a <i>really</i> difficult class over a difficult class), and was anxious that I'd made the wrong decision. However, it quickly became the class I most look forward to, and I figured that even if I don't do as well in it as I would like, it'll be a valuable experience nevertheless.
    <br><br>
    On January 20th, I started learning how to crochet, since I'd been considering it for some time. I bought a Woobles crochet kit, and it really is as helpful as the reviews make it out to be. Here's the last photo I have of what I was working on:
    <br><br>
    <img src="/images/for-posts/woobles.png" width="340px">
    <br><br>
    Also, I don't remember when I started, but lately I've been reading <i>Algorithms to Live By</i>, which I'm really enjoying. It feels good to take up reading books again; I haven't really had the motivation to read for a long time. As for other media I've enjoyed this month, I also played Class of '09 (both the OG and the re-up) with my friend on VC. It's really unhinged, and unfortunately kind of does live up to its title as a culturally accurate game.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Finally, on January 29th (just two days ago 😭), my dorm flooded. There was a leak in the air vent so big that the garbage can I put under it filled in a matter of minutes. Less than half an hour later, the water covered the entire hardwood floor in the suite, and poured out of the front door. Because of the damage, my roommate and I ended up being permanently relocated to a different dorm in the building, so we spent the evening moving our things.

    February 2024
    <br>03.04.2024
    <br><br>
    School has picked up the pace since January. It feels like every week now I study very hard during the weekdays and then crash over the weekend (Which is probably why I'm writing my February post over break in March...). Balancing my schedule has proven to be tricky, but it is getting better with time.
    <br><br>
    I'm learning a lot in college. For one, I went from making tiny karnaugh maps for rudimentary logic gates in Nand2Tetris to doing up to 6-variable karnaugh maps (That's four 4x4 tables) and building much more complicated circuits. I feel like I'm able to understand exponentially more and more as I continue, and it's pretty awesome.
    <br><br>
    Math is still my favorite class, even though it's easily the most difficult I've taken yet. It turns out that proof writing is fun enough to rival calculus. Now that I can write my own proofs, revisiting proofs I've seen in the past is mindblowing because I can actually understand the underlying logic. We had our first exam a few weeks ago, and I scored among the best in the class, so I'm really happy about that too.
    <br><br>
    In February, I also turned 19. For a while, my birthday used to make me vaguely upset, because I'd worry about not having done enough with my life to be [insert] age, or whatnot. But now I can honestly say that I'm at peace with myself.
    <br><br>
    As for media I enjoyed this month, I started playing Stardew Valley, and continued reading my book (<i>Algorithms to Live By</i>), but didn't get as far as I would've liked. I also haven't finished the crochet I started (Man :horse:), so here's to hoping I finish that and my book next month. Stardew Valley is fun, though. I like the relaxed pace of the game, and fishing, and raising chickens.

    March 2024
    <br>03.31.2024
    <br><br>
    There isn't much that went on this month that I haven't mentioned previously. School has continued to be busy, though thankfully not in a dull or overwhelming way, and the class I'm taking that's informally described by some as "discrete math on crack" is still my most favorite. And I'm still, to my own disbelief, doing great in the class.
    <br><br>
    I spent the first week of March at home doing pretty much nothing, and once I got back to school, the two weeks that followed were a flurry of rigorous assignments and exams. By the time the end of the month came around, well, let's just say I was less enthused by studying than usual.
    <br><br>
    I've also continued playing Stardew Valley, though in intermittent bouts of procrastination. About two weeks ago, I started reading Franz Kafka's <i>The Trial</i>, from which I was reminded that fictional narrative is a much smoother read than textbooks or even popular science books (I felt a little better about my purported lack of reading after that). And yesterday, I spent the afternoon finishing up <i>Algorithms to Live By</i>, the book I'd started in January. I liked it a lot; I found the game theory chapter near the end really interesting (and lost my shit when they quoted Noam Nisan).
    <br><br>
    Ideally, next month I'd draw more, finish my crochet project from January, and revisit neglected coding projects. Realistically though, I'm not sure I'll get around to much, because for the most part, I just want to end the semester well. I'll also have to figure out what to do with my summer.

    April 2024
    <br>05.03.2024
    <br><br>
    The school year is finally over. I'm sitting in my empty dorm room as I write this.
    <br><br>
    April was easily my worst month yet, psychologically speaking. I felt hazy and pessimistic on an almost daily basis. I put myself under immense pressure, and, leading up to every deadline, kept insisting to myself that I'd screw up (To put it lightly and briefly). It was an exhausting way to live, and looking back, I'm not sure why I felt the need to impose all that on myself. Maybe it's the general dissatisfaction with the routines of my everyday life speaking, but I'm not even remotely as satisfied as I thought I'd be with my good grades.
    <br><br>
    I'm still not so sure what I want to do with my summer, aside from generally trying to become a more functional adult, and my usual computers stuff. I've never felt the need to talk about this on here until recently, but I often can't help but wonder if there's more to life than this. I feel like I forget <i>I actually like what I'm studying</i> too often for my own comfort, at least in the past month. I even started feeling sick of math as finals approached.
    <br><br>
    Amidst the stress, I still managed to sit down and write a few proofs for a textbook I've been side-eyeing for a while (Sipser's Theory of Computation, which I've probably mentioned on my NC profile), and honestly really liked it. I guess I mostly need to stop burdening myself with my own expectations. It's definitely been discouraging me from drawing, too, which is...unfortunate. I used to fill sketchbook after sketchbook when I was younger, but in the past few years or so, even finishing a single piece is a pain.
    <br><br>
    I'm not exactly sure how to "fix" this, but hopefully it'll help not to have as many obligations in the summer. I figure it'd feel worse to end 2024 still feeling like this, so until then, I'll do my best to change things.

    May 2024
    <br>06.11.2024
    <br><br>
    May was so uneventful that I'm not sure what to say about it, but for consistency's sake, I'll try to throw something out anyway.
    <br><br>
    I moved out of my school dorm at the beginning of the month, and then kind of did whatever at home. Some time during the month, I revamped some site pages and code, started working on an Enigma machine simulator in C, and got weirdly knowledgeable about Jojo Siwa's backstory via YouTube video essays (Please don't talk to me about it, I've heard enough). I also got halfway through like two books.
    <hr>
    June 2024
    <br>07.16.2024
    <br><br>
    At the beginning of June I tried to commit to going to the library daily to read and code, only for it to get so hot I stopped feeling up to the roughly half hour walk there. <img src="/images/emotes/nukoFatigue.gif" class="emote"> It didn't help that my room started getting uncomfortably warm too.
    <br><br>
    As it was no longer appropriate to be in the post-school slump that characterized the month of May, I also tried, more sucessfully, to focus on doing what's meaningful to me (instead of going about my days somewhat aimlessly). I made some art I'm happy with, namely an MS Paint rendition of <i>La Scapigliata</i>, and a new pagedoll for my site. I also finished reading <i>Existential Physics</i>, started reading <i>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</i> (a book I've been wanting to read for <i>months</i>), did a few Nand2Tetris projects, and started practicing to get my driver's license. At some point I even went to see a baseball game, so that was pretty cool too.
    <br><br>
    Nearing the end of the month, I set my phone to grayscale indefinitely, and deactivated all my social media. I haven't really seen the point of using it for a while now, so this was a long time coming. Since I mostly like to log into social media to see what other people are up to, I figure if I want to keep up with friends there are much better ways to do it.
    <br><br>
    Also, I'm now realizing that I didn't mention anything about finals week in my April or May posts, so I guess I'll tack it in now. Anyways, going in to take a few exams during finals was a lot less stressful for me than the week before, when I had several big projects due around the same time. I did generally pretty good both weeks though, and best of all I got a 100% on my discrete math final <img src="/images/emotes/nukoHappyDance.gif" class="emote"> It still astonishes me that I managed to pull that off, especially since I didn't feel like I reviewed that much. I guess not having to cram was a good sign; studying consistently seriously goes a long way. I'm glad to have had a pretty solid first year (academically, anyway) to give myself more confidence in my abilities from this point onward.
    <br><br>
    To get back onto the original topic of the post, I recall feeling that day-to-day life in June (and summer so far in general) felt inexplicably like it was missing something. Though I like to say that being at school was much better, I'm honestly not sure it was. I probably should have cared more about things like socializing or decorating my room, instead of just studying. And as for right now, I should probably be online less <img src="/images/emotes/nukoForcedLaugh.gif" class="emote">
