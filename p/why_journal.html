I started this online journal because of my general tendency to talk a lot about things I really like. Each category was named for a topic I'm interested in, such as theoretical computer science or assembly language, and I intended to ramble about them. However, when I tried to sit myself down and write, I couldn't help but feel a sense of meaninglessness. What did I really know about anything, anyway? What could I possibly contribute that other people have not? 
<br><br>I've since taken time to develop a clearer purpose for this page and to reframe my perspective. In sum, <b>I aim to become more articulate about things that I care about</b>. I've also found that urging myself to write about my life and the various things I spend my time on allow me to reflect thoughtfully and critically on what I do and why it means something to me (When it comes to documenting my computer projects specifically, it also helps to write things down so I don't forget later). As such, I think it'd be nice to continue doing this indefinitely. It's not that I'm self-important and think I have lots of great things to say or anything; for a while I was shocked that anyone actually reads this stuff at all. I'd say I mostly do this for myself (frankly, I would have stopped doing this long ago if otherwise), but if what I put out inspires or entertains somebody else too, I'd be very glad.
