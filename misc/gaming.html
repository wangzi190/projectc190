<b>Gamer backstory, or something</b>
<br>I started out playing a bunch of the web games, Flash games, and kids MMOs of the 2000s. They were a blast! To this day I still find so much joy in the bright colors and whimsical designs and concepts characteristic of these games. And man I miss stuff like Neopets Habitarium and being able to visit your friend's houses in Webkinz. RIP Flash.
<br>Later in 2020, I unfortunately started playing Genshin. I didn't play it for long, but it still like, started something. I think I was unknowingly in some sort of gacha community echochamber because every hot new game I heard about was gacha.
Because I'd only really played web games before, I started thinking that the gacha business model was the norm for video games at large, which was pretty awful to say the least.
<br>Disengaging from these games was a struggle, but I managed. I really liked Honkai Impact 3rd part 1, and didn't want to stick around for part 2, so I quit gachas entirely around its release. Many of these games have VNs, mangas, or other more enjoyable supplemental material if I want to experience more of the story and characters anyway. And even if gacha games can sometimes be fun, the gameplay loops tend to be too grindy and mind-numbing, and I hate feeling like I have to keep playing lest I miss out on something.
<br>Now I pretty much just play games to chill or connect with friends, online ones or otherwise, and it's so much better this way.
I really like Stardew Valley for how it's easy to play to relax, and put down when I'm busy. It's very suited to my needs, and also has a pretty fun co-op mode. I'm also into revisiting childhood favorites (or at least, the ones that are still alive), and a visual novel here and there.
