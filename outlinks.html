<br><i>"We now depend upon the internet just to participate effectively in our daily lives. Whether it's interfacing with the IRS or your health care provider, nearly everything we do now just to fulfill the barest requirements of social participation marches us through the same channels that are surveillance capitalism's supply chains."</i>

Intellectual property is theft, sometimes in part from an individual creator but always from society as a whole."</i>

Their art will not be set free nor truly understood and neither will they."</i>

<br><i>"... [D]espite [GC] claims about being critical of the gender system, the deep sense of gender polarity they end up embracing is in fact a product of it. The intense meaning we give to sex difference, often to the point of considering men and women essentially distinct types of beings ... doesn't arise from nature. It's a product of society, and one historically linked to maintaining male solidarity. What would have been a single neutral trait is blown up into a defining characteristic [...]."</i>
