        <summary><i>IBM and the Holocaust</i> by Edwin Black</summary>
        <div class="review">
        I wanted to read this book because I felt that my understanding of the development of computers throughout history was too politically detached for something that had largely been spurred by wartime conditions. Though I began reading with probably a far greater cynicism toward Big Tech than the average person, nothing could have prepared me for how blatantly and self-evidently evil the actions described in the book were.
        <br><br>IBM and the Holocaust lays out in painstaking detail how IBM colluded with the Nazis to enable automated mass genocide at lightning efficiency, presenting excerpts of countless cross-referenced documents and internal communications from numerous countries in context to recover the true story. It is both an immensely valuable piece of Holocaust history and grim evidence that powerful people who value profit and capital over having a conscience can get away with enabling even the most heinous crimes against humanity. The Third Reich heavily relied on IBM's punch cards and tabulating machines to ensure unprecedented levels of efficiency in everything from running the trains on time to identifying and tracking Jewish people in occupied territories for imminent extermination. It is no exaggeration to say that the Nazis couldn't have done damage at such an immense speed and scale without the recurring help of IBM. Suffice to say you will constantly be wishing a special place in hell exists for these people.
        <br><br>This book is so thoroughly researched and meticulously fact-checked I felt a strong obligation to go through it cover to cover, carefully reading every word, and I'm glad I gave it the time and energy it deserved. I firmly agree with the author that you should not skip around in the book. I don't think I would've understood Watson's dishonest business decisions or the exceptions American officials were willing to make for him the same way had I not read the initial chapters characterizing Watson and describing the "cult-like atmopshere" surrounding him and IBM. You definitely need to process all the details in order and in context for the clearest understanding.
        <br><br>The book's descriptions of punch cards being so useful and information-rich that they are practically paper manifestations of each human being eerily reminded me of the countless individual profiles that corporations like Google and Microsoft have already created off of the world's data. I'm not saying that big tech companies are going to orchestrate the next Holocaust or something, but it's truly eye-opening and paranoia-inducing to understand just how powerful the ability to quickly process and analyze massive amounts of data is, and the sheer magnitude of evil it can be used for. While this book is incredibly hefty and incredibly grim, I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.

        <summary><i>Dumbing Us Down</i> by John Taylor Gatto</summary>
        <div class="review">
        In this book, award-winning schoolteacher John Taylor Gatto describes facets of American public schooling with biting but warranted criticism, explaining its institutional issues, its negative effects on children, and why proposed solutions never seem to eliminate its problems.
        <br><br>I think Gatto is highly attuned to students' thoughts, feelings, and needs, and, because of that, is able to accurately evaluate the damage traditional schooling causes to children, families, communities, and society at large. Personally, his words are a poignant reminder of my own, also rather negative experiences with the K-12 public school system, and an impactful reassurance that I wasn't some sort of deplorable fuckup, just a human being seeking a basic sense of self-fulfillment amid the soulless grind, repetition, and competition of school. His thinking is very much contingent on a refusal to view school in its own special vacuum, instead acknowledging it as anti-human and detached from the parts of life that truly matter. Most critically, he emphasizes that the system of institutionalized schooling is, by creating incompetent, controllable people, doing exactly what it was designed to do, which is why it is structually unreformable and needs its influence significantly minimized.
        <br><br>Despite this book's heavy focus on the American public school system, I found that the author makes very astute observations of how institutionalized schooling and other means of institutional control over public life affects American society, making for phenomenons of mass loneliness and mass indifference. I also really liked the way he explained how manufactured competition fuels the continued relevance of education as an institution, and found it interesting how his descriptions of television's negative impacts could be said about the Internet and social media today. Here is one of my favorite excerpts from the book:
        <br><img src="/images/for-posts/dud_gatto.png" class="image" width="440px">
        <br><br>In sum, this book is written by someone who clearly knows what's going on, and I'd recommend it whether you're totally jaded about institutionalized schooling or just generally sense that something's off.

        <div class="review">
            <img src="/images/for-posts/glt_travelers.png" class="image" width="550px">
            <br>Taking place in a post-apocalyptic world, this manga depicts the everyday life of two travelers, Chito and Yuuri, as they tour a cold, desolate city, finding food, supplies, and ancient human relics they try to make sense of. In short, I really liked reading this. It's deeply existential, exploring the purpose of human existence and the meaning of life and death, and, despite the abysmal setting, strangely very beautiful. There's something almost idyllic and comforting in the way Chito and Yuuri go about their lives. It's like pure, unadulterated human existence. I think reading about it made me feel things I don't experience enough in my own day-to-day life. Somehow, it resonated with me enough that I feel more connected to myself and my feelings, and able to be more carefree.
            <br>I also really, really like the illustration, which I think complements the story well. The characters are drawn in a cute and simple way, whereas the scenery and other objects are drawn in a sketchy, detailed way with a somewhat dark and grimy quality, which does a lot to emphasize the smallness of the characters in contrast to the vast abandoned city that has existed for countless generations. It also has the added bonus of giving me an itch to start drawing just looking at it; I feel like simple characters contrasted with otherwise-detailed illustrations is right up my alley, both in terms of general taste and what I personally like to draw.
            <br>I'd highly recommend this manga, and the Girl's Last Tour anime is definitely on my to-watch list now too.

        <summary><i>Right-Wing Women</i> by Andrea Dworkin</summary>
        <div class="review">
            In Right-Wing Women, Dworkin elaborates at length on the dehumanizing mechanisms of patriarchy, and explains why right-wing women accept it for what it is in order to make what they perceive as "the better deal" in a society that does not value women. She thoroughly explains right-wing women's reasoning instead of dismissing them as too stupid to understand the harms of male supremacy, which I found insightful even if I fundamentally disagree. Though some may consider the way she writes to be too charged and vulgar, I find many of the author's articulations about feminist issues, such as the so-called separate-but-equal model and the systematic denial of women's self-actualization and bodily autonomy, to be incredibly on the mark. She is "extreme", but almost never without some element of truth. I think accurately assessing the mass degradation of women under patriarchy necessarily entails some ugly and unsettling language, and that Dworkin used it in a way that is, for the most part, substantive to her argument. I felt so vindicated at her explanations of the social, political, and sexual subjugation of women throughout history as what it was—deliberate cruelty—rather than a natural side effect of war or "woman's nature" or whatnot. The intellectual rigor with which she asserts feminist thought is truly vindicating.
	    <br><br>My problem with this book is mostly with how people use it to defend bioessentialist definitions of womanhood, when really it describes the inherent bioessentialism of the patriarchy without much comment on whether it truthfully defines womanhood—a different question entirely. Even then, Dworkin states verbatim that "feminists propose that women are not their sex" and "no sexual dichotomy is compatible with real liberation". Being on this topic, I firmly believe that radical feminists who defend bioessentialism in evaluating woman's condition often make the fallacies of 1) creating arbitrary restrictions on what defines a woman, excluding people who undergo dehumanizing sex-based subjugation of a similar nature from their evaluation of the sex-class system, and 2) internalizing the idea that male domination and violence is an unavoidable fact of "biology", both of which harm feminist analysis. Contrary to popular belief, I do not think radical feminism inherently opposes transgender rights nor do I think it should, and ultimately, my verdict on this book is that it is great overall but unfortunately misinterpreted.

        <summary><i>How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems</i> by Randall Munroe</summary>
        <div class="review">
            This is going to sound like one of those excessively positive reviews they put on the inside covers of books, but I don't care, because I express this from the depths of my soul. This book is simply a masterpiece, the pinnacle of book-entertainment dare I say. It's like science, but with a dose of those delirious conversations you have with your friends where each person says something more absurd than the one before, and before you know it you're all uncontrollably laughing. Each chapter presents a realistic problem and explores a bunch of fun and wacky ways to solve it, with comic illustrations in between. It's lighthearted, delightfully educational, and sometimes unexpectedly deep; there was probably no point in this book where I wasn't thoroughly enjoying it. I learned all sorts of interesting things, from why we need leap seconds in modern timekeeping to how atmospheric nuclear bomb testing affected carbon dating. If you like xkcd, this is an absolute must-read.

        <summary><i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i> by Rebecca Skloot</summary>
        <div class="review">
            I began reading this not knowing anything about HeLa cells, much less the story of the woman behind them, Henrietta Lacks, and this book enlightened me on the subject in a highly descriptive and intimate way. It's interesting and almost magical to see the reporter, Skloot, so deeply invested and personally tied to the story she is writing about. She spent the course of years earning the trust of the Lacks family, piecing together the story as accurately as possible, and bringing it to life beautifully.
            In case you are just as unaware as I was before I read the book: Henrietta's cells, which were pivotal to modern science research, even enabling researchers to develop a polio vaccine, are already very well documented. However, the cells' true origins remained obscure for a long time, and even Henrietta's family was largely left in the dark.
            <br><br>
            Skloot really has a knack for describing people and expressing to you their human-ness. I liked the way she described how Henrietta mischievously snuck out with her friends to go dancing, how she meticulously painted and re-painted her nails bright red, and how her cancer affected her physically and emotionally over time. I feel like I learned who she really was, as if she's someone I could've personally known. Aside from giving you a meaningful glimpse into Henrietta's life, the book also provides a detailed background of the atrocities committed by medical researchers experimenting on black people, and the shockingly poor ethical standards for medical research in general. The horrifying context really helped put into perspective for me why the Lacks family were so distrustful, and why Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter, struggled with such severe anxiety and stress not knowing what really happened to her mother. I found it valuable to understand this story based on the thoughts and experiences of the Lacks family, who, in spite of the numerous researchers whose careers exist entirely thanks to the availability and robustness of HeLa, have perhaps the most significant stake in it. I can't help but wonder how my perception might've differed if I first learned about HeLa and Henrietta Lacks from a research perspective.

        <summary><i>Infect Your Friends and Loved Ones</i> by Torrey Peters</summary>
        <div class="review">
            I read this novella while bored one evening. The story premise is pretty interesting; basically, it's set in a post-apocalyptic timeline where a mass contagion prevents people's bodies from producing sex hormones, giving everybody the ability to choose which to sustain themselves with. I expected it to be pretty heavy on worldbuilding due to the subject matter, only instead it was much more character-focused. It's not that that's necessarily bad, but I think the short length of the book meant I had a harder time investing in the characters than I would when reading other ones. There are some pretty hard-hitting excerpts, though, and I like how it's more just raw and honest speculative fiction involving trans perspectives instead of "activism". It's definitely a refreshing read amidst a political landscape that has its priorities skewed, one that threatens to strip away the collective rights of marginalized groups at any perceived misstep.

        <summary><i>Convenience Store Woman</i> by Sayaka Murata</summary>
        <div class="review">
            This book tells the story of a woman who's been working the same dead-end job for 18 years, only it's so much more interesting than that would lead you to believe! The way it manages to depict the mundane setting of a convenience store in a completely new light, that is, from the view of Furukura, who feels that she can only be a functioning member of society within a convenience store, is amazing. I feel like people who think she is "quirky" just cannot comprehend a protagonist who doesn't think exactly like them, because given what the story has established about what kind of person she is, her perspectives and reasoning make a lot of sense. I related to her on the basis of living in a society with similar values, a society that tells women that living and behaving as a "normal" woman is more important than doing what truly fulfills them. Ignoring Furukura's own outlook on her life, the people she knows instead opt to focus on her "weird" mannerisms and the way she has not married a man and had children at her age. I can understand people who think that the author didn't go far enough with the social commentary in this book, but I think the sheer hypocrisy of the incel character, and the ways he, another "social reject", differs from Furukura, was pretty good social commentary in itself.

        <summary><i>Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention</i> by Johann Hari</summary>
        <div class="review">
            Since reading this book and learning just how fragile human attention can be, I have definitely found myself being more careful with my sleep, diet, and exercise so that my brain is better equipped to focus well. So in that sense, I think this book has done what it needs to do. But I will admit that I found this author pretty irritating, particularly in the earlier chapters. In the book, he reports facts relevant to attention and focus from experts in a variety of different fields (such as neuroscientists, psychologists, and the designers and engineers of our electronic devices), and interleaves these facts with his experiences with quitting the Internet and modern electronics entirely for a few months. This personal touch would've been nice if he yammered a lot less about irrelevant details, such as how seeing that he missed almost no emails when he returned to the Internet bruised his ego or whatever. It's almost as if you shouldn't alienate your readers with unnecessary details when writing about a problem you are trying to frame as ubiquitous. That being said, it's not difficult to read through to get to the valuable details, it's more just a gripe I have that I wonder why more people don't talk about. Also, I only found out about this weeks after finishing the book, but his absolute dumpster fire of a Wikipedia page really makes me doubt his integrity as an author now. I probably would've once actively recommended this book to others, but I'm not sure that I will anymore.
